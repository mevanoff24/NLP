i think -PRON- ' a libyan
i be from bennettsville south carolina
i be what you may call a redneck
okay brainstorm
how do we make this park happen
let 's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money
no park be not a priority
i need more firepower

what about bring mark on board
which mark
which mark
mark brendanawicz

he plant his flag in the ground and be meet soon after by an angry tribe of wamapoke indians who when see the whiteness of his skin twist him to death
flash forward to 1969
man walk on the moon
pawnee be lousy with hippie my god
-PRON- ' filibuster her own meeting
filibuster

they can not touch you if you talk forever
i can not speak of the future but i will
the future of pawnee will involve us fly around in space taxi where we will communicate on watch and blink our feeling to each other rather than use word

now marcia what if anything can miss knope do to make it right
joan we do not want to be unreasonable

we think that she should separate the penguin annul the marriage reimburse the taxpayer for the cost of the wedding of course and then resign
oh
be that it

anything else
you want me to jump off a building
perform hara kiri

-PRON- be sorry you do not think -PRON- ' weird that my ex boyfriend live in a tent in the pit outside my house

this be not the first time that susans have lose to trishes and it wo not be the last

mmm hmm
in my defense it be my birthday and i really want to do it
i think -PRON- ' a real shame when people focus on the tawdry detail of a scandal
personally all i care about be councilman dexhart 's policy
not whether he be high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex
which by the way i hear he be
one more shocking revelation in a story that just wo not stop unfold
it turn out councilman dexhart may have also have sex with a prostitute in the limousine on the way to and from the press conference where he apologize for have an affair

and -PRON- ' very controversial
-PRON- have have someone throw acid at it tomato sauce
someone try to stab it once
we really need good security here
we also need good less offensive history
so the city council have decide that the spirit of pawnee should be change to something just a little less horrifying

i have no interest in art
let me clarify
i have no interest in non nude image
dude what the hell kind of art be this
it look like a lizard puke up skittles
-PRON- be an abstract expressionist
no -PRON- 're a con artist
and -PRON- be a guy that ' out 20 buck
ugh
whatever
-PRON- be a terrible artist
but the parks department have do so much for me that if i can help them out in any way i will
oh god
maybe i should just give them all free flu shot
i know everything about this town and these mural
and that ' why this be a dream come true
literally
i have have a dream where i design a mural
but then it turn into a nightmare because the mural start talk and it come alive and it be whisper
and i could not hear what it be say so i lean in close and then it eat me
at one point gina gershon be there
my piece be truly go to capture the spirit of pawnee
i never understand the term elbow grease
i guess -PRON- ' not really grease
just hard work
oh hey ron nice shiny shoe you get there
oh
hey
i be just
i think
oh no
shoot
actually it look like i scuff this one
do you need your money back ron
because i already spend it
really
how do never mind
i think -PRON- will just take another full polish
can i cut in line again
i feel right at home as a shoe shiner
i have no idea what -PRON- be do but i know -PRON- be do it really really well
okay
let 's get go with the spirit of pawnee
ann you go first
okay
um okay
well since -PRON- ' the parks department i think i would design a pretty park
with dog play
and i can not really draw so i just cut some stuff out of a magazine
that look like something a death row convict would make in art therapy
dude i try
and you fail
-PRON- ' dog and people play in a park
-PRON- ' cute
-PRON- ' okay sweetheart
you can not make art because you be art
-PRON- 're beautiful
but that suck
okay
let 's see yours
fine
mine be amazing
-PRON- ' go to blow your mind
okay
this be some professional as art right here
-PRON- be not quite sure what -PRON- be look at
-PRON- ' abstract leslie
over here -PRON- have get some shape
and then you come over to this side you know
-PRON- ' actually kind of interesting
each shape be its own thing
but then when it come together it really give you a sense of completion
hmm
a piece of art cause me to have an emotional reaction
be that normal
so -PRON- ' the last supper but with famous people from indiana
mmm hmm
john mellencamp larry bird michael jackson uh david letterman vivica a. fox
okay so here ' where it get a little dicey
because there ' not that many celebrity from indiana
so a nascar
uh my friend becky ron swanson
donna
who ' the jesus
that would be greg kinnear
i do not know he be from indiana
yeah you know i read that he be
oh
do you think -PRON- ' the good choice for jesus
i mean he be great on er
greg kinnear be not in er
yeah he be
i do not think that he be
who be i think of
okay
next
wow
really good jerry
for my murinal i be inspire by the death of my grandma
you say murinal
she
no i do n't
yes you do
you say murinal
i hear it
anyway she jerry
why do not you put that murinal in the man 's room so people can murinate all over it
jerry
go to the doctor
you may have a murinary tract infection
i just want to show you my art
murinal
murinal
murinal
disqualified
-PRON- ' pointillism
and each dot be a photo of a citizen of the town
no one care
at all
okay
so this be a multimedia project
first a bunch of rat make out of garbage
and this be a tv screen
-PRON- will be like a big flat screen tv and it will play looped video of knee surgery
and then this be a human sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one
and it will be spin and there will be like a fat guy in it all the time like scream and like eat raw beef and like bleeding
and like blood will like come out of his mouth and stuff
and that will be like right next to the mural
i have one question
why
if you have to ask you do not get it
i do not think they really get the assignment
if -PRON- 're gon na beat all the other department we have to choose something that will stand the test of time
like the mona lisa
or the music of squeeze
june 8 1922
the pawnee bread factory burn to the ground
we lose a lot of good bread that day
as well as several human life
and it also make the whole town smell like toast
which one resident describe as disturbingly enticing
but i digress
the point be we rebuilt pawnee to the wonderful town that it be today
why would you want a mural that show people die when you could have shape that come alive
well because -PRON- ' the most famous event in our town 's history
and people love vote for tragedy
look at the oscars
this be our holocaust movie
this be our english patient
it sound like -PRON- 're exploit the tragedy
see ann get it
okay
time to vote everybody
cast your vote
may the good most tragic project win
when we start this we be six different voice with six idea for a mural
and then those six voice come together as a team
there be no loser today
but there be one winner us
the parks department
tom the result of the vote please
one to one to one- to one to one to one
we all vote for ourselves do not we
yeah
okay
third time today
mmm
that ' a good shoeshine
what the man
i
i do not know what happen
frankly
i emit a noise
the noise be involuntary
sometimes a sound be just a sound
you know
we need to whittle these down
can we all agree on eliminate any of these design
ann 's blow
wow
do not hold back
no offense but -PRON- ' a giant picture of a park
that ' not art
well at least -PRON- ' not a fat human hamster eat meat
you do not even work here
okay guy you both have a point
ann yours be a little trite
and april yours be hellish and may make someone vomit
thank you
look there ' something about those shape
there ' some emotional art right there
any kid could do that
no kid could do that
only god could do that
what be so great about the shape
he like the shape okay
and -PRON- ' part of the team
so here
take these scissors and cut out your favorite shape
and then -PRON- will put them on a new team mural
-PRON- 're go to make a new design that take the good part of all of our design
-PRON- ' like if you get michelangelo and andy warhol and jackson pollock and jim davis from garfield to do one painting
imagine how good that paint would be
i think -PRON- ' really good
-PRON- will be right back
brendanawicz
we need you for something
can it wait
i be so swamp here
ann ' in trouble
we think it may be pill
what
no
that ' a lie
but this be just as important
we need you to look at a piece of art
oh god
what be that
this be our entry for the mural contest
we could not decide on one design so we take part that we all like of our design and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing
well you make a camel

-PRON- be not gon na stab you in the back or anything so maybe i should go somewhere
maybe i should move to eagleton
oh god the thought of that
leslie you do not have to move to eagleton
when i become city manager my job be yours
of course my first act as city manager will be to propose eliminate the parks department
although i expect a spirited debate with leslie
who know what the future hold for me
maybe -PRON- will leapfrog ron 's job and become city manager
of course my first act as city manager would be to double the size of the parks department
although i do expect a fight from ron
but -PRON- will win
mmm

but we do not want to sell any of our major asset because we do not want to lose out on any future revenue stream
i hear that
do not worry
i have ton more idea
okay
uh so sorry
new ring tone
do not cut anything without me
leslie
i do not care if you hate what we do
i love it enough for both of us
-PRON- 're go to put on the freddy spaghetti concert today 5:00 on lot 48

this one be a little complicated
i know what will loosen up our brain
massage train
and i know what -PRON- 're think
-PRON- ' not that i want a massage
-PRON- will be the caboose
and ron swanson be the locomotive
and thanks to ron the service budget have already be cut significantly
so seem like the good option be job cut
start with leslie knope
no no no no no
if you fire leslie you may as well just get rid of the department
look i know how valuable she be believe me
but -PRON- have run out of option
there be plenty of other option
for example sell the zoo animal
okay
to whom
cosmetic lab
weird restaurant
-PRON- be just spit ball here
okay let 's switch it up
look she make the second high salary in the department
it will go a long way
-PRON- be tell you

-PRON- ' because whenever i see you talk to ann or talk about ann i feel like you still have feeling for her
what
no i do n't
but i do n't
really i do n't
well i think you do
so that ' a problem for me
because of my libertarian belief leslie do 95% of the work
so you should lie me off
-PRON- would be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war
-PRON- ' precisely because of your belief that we need to keep you
you would maintain fiscal responsibility after -PRON- 're go
i strenuously object
okay

every department be lose a leslie knope

budget solution number 28
use graze sheep to mow grass in park
note
tired sheep could become food or sweater
well i get my answer
about april
she hat me
yeah
and she get a boyfriend i guess
from some city in mexico
so what do i do
okay
well when your back 's against the wall and odds be stack against you you just you you swing the hard damn it
you go big or you go home
and you do not seem like the kind of guy who go home
-PRON- be not
i do not even really have a home
go get her andy
okay
okay thanks leslie
okay
so we know the people who run this government have no faith in us
my plan be go to change that and bring the budget back
and the answer ' be right in front of us the whole time
check your testicle
no
not that
although that be very good advice
look at you jerry
no
what ' go to save us be right there
gentlemen i realize that time be tough and the budget be tight
but if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their house and play video game then pawnee will die
and we refuse to let that happen
now
this town be historically know for two thing
widespread obesity and the annual pawnee harvest festival
people from all over indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizen be
and while they be here they would also attend the festival a full week of corn maze hay ride ferris wheel pumpkins the size ofjeeps
we lose that festival a few year ago due to another round of budget cut
and i propose we bring the festival back
with ticket sale and corporate sponsorship -PRON- will earn all that money back
and believe me people will come
what if they do not
well then you eliminate the parks department
and you guy be all on board with this
aye
yes
look -PRON- 're not just pencil pusher
we be a reflection of the community
and we believe that we can strengthen that community
because in the end the reason why -PRON- 're all here be to bring people together
that literally be the most moving thing -PRON- have ever hear
and a good idea
yeah all right
excellent
great
okay
so everybody -PRON- 're go to party hard for 15 minute and then -PRON- 're go to have our first brainstorming session
hello april
do you like the flower
what be you do
all due respect eduardo
you seem like a great guy
but i like april

so do you want to go out with me

i think you be go to say yes
but that ' okay
because -PRON- will be back tomorrow to ask you again
and again the next day
and the next day
not friday
i have to go visit my cousin
but i will be back after that to ask you again
you should do it
follow your dream
oh my god
really
that ' awesome
-PRON- will see you tomorrow
okay jerry what have you choose to put in the time capsule
these be my mother 's diary
wow

mmm

i could not really get into it though

but i look in the inside cover and i see this
do a little research and liz waverly be 12 year old a straight
a student at king philip middle
-PRON- ' also a member of many twilight internet message board and -PRON- be guess your daughter
be that why you do this
to impress your daughter
liz 's mom and i divorce a couple year ago and -PRON- ' be really hard on her
she love twilight
so i read about your time capsule and i think that if i could somehow convince you to get it in there -PRON- would be a big hero
that ' really sweet
you should have tell me you be do this for your daughter
i do not want to drag her into it
-PRON- be sorry
this be a mistake
you do not have to put twilight in the time capsule
i think we should put twilight in the time capsule
leslie no
we do not negotiate with weirdoes
yeah what happen to a perfect encapsulation of life in pawnee
well for that guy life in pawnee be him and his daughter read that book
besides i can get shauna on board
it would make a great human interest story
uh if this get out every time you want to do anything some guy 's gon na come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe
well yeah that ' a good point
then we shall bring the pipe to them
oh no
oh yes
what do that mean
crackpot convention
so that ' what today 's forum be for
-PRON- 're gon na hear suggestion from everyone and then whichever item we generally agree on will go into the time capsule
please remember this be a government project so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious item
who 'd like to start
i think we should put in the bible
great
eduardo

so we have one very moving case for twilight
anyone else
great
two people for twilight
oh no no no no
-PRON- be marcia langman from the society for family stability foundation
this book contain pagan creature and strong sexual overtone
there be girl quiver
there be boy star deeply into girl eye as they quiver and so forth
there really be a tremendous amount of quivering
it be anti christian it be pro quivering and the government have no business promote it
i totally disagree
well now we have two people for twilight
absolutely not
-PRON- be with the national civil liberties association
that book actually contain overt christian theme and as such have no business be associate with any government project
so too christian and not christian enough
do you see the irony here
no
okay
uh donna why do not you put a question mark next to twilight
no
you promise
you promise
that ' not fair
wait -PRON- ' not a question of fairness
-PRON- ' go back to russia commie
hey you go back to russia
you go back to wherever you come from
why would i go to russia
i have no interest in travel to russia
can i just say that
and who else
i would like to include my favorite book crazy from the heat the david lee roth story
well i think if -PRON- 're gon na be add a book to the time capsule it would probably be twilight
i do not care about twilight
why be this only about his favorite book
i want my favorite book in there
okay i have an idea
two time capsule
one that totally encapsulate what ' happen right now in pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that ' just for item of personal significance like twilight
no twilight
yes twilight
hey
hey
thanks for come
i only have a second
i have to get to work
bella ' go on her first hunt
i just do not get why you break up with me
be it 'cause -PRON- be not cool enough
like the normal kid compare to the vampire
be it an edward bella jacob type situation where you like me but there ' someone else you like more
uh -PRON- ' nothing to do with twilight
it just do not work out
okay
well what difference do it make
if we stay together you probably would have just dump me for ron
actually that ' the reason
i believe you when you say that -PRON- 're not in love with wendy anymore but -PRON- 're definitely not cool with her date ron
you talk about it constantly
well i can not help it okay
i mean -PRON- ' so manly and -PRON- ' my bos
imagine if your bos be angelina jolie and then one day she just start date your ex boyfriend
would not that freak you out a little bit
well not if i have a great new boyfriend dumbass
look tom i like you
-PRON- 're really cute and -PRON- 're funny and -PRON- 're small enough for me to throw you around
so if you ever work through this then give me a call
my grandmother live in pawnee for 60 year and i wanna put her ash in the time capsule
my cat turnip be the great cat ever and -PRON- would like to put his ash in the time capsule
for the last time and i wo not say this again there will be no human or feline ash in either one of the time capsule
except for turnip
except for turnip
no chanting
look we do not know what the world be go to be like in 50 year
we could all have be wipe out from disease or the flu
so what ' your suggestion
i do not know
-PRON- be just scared
hey
aw
andy
i get two microphone a four track recorder and every bass tab to dave matthews ever
-PRON- 're gon na jam for like nine hour
be that cool

that ' ridiculous
now why should the bill of rights be in the official time capsule but this painting of my dog be in time capsule seven
well i think pet paintingslashes be in time capsule four
no that ' baseball card
no baseball card be in time capsule nine childhood memorabilia
honestly twilight could go in almost any of these category
oh shut up kelly

okay let 's take a 10-minute break
oh god
this time capsule 's tear this town apart
-PRON- 're leave soon
can i blame it on you in the press

-PRON- have be to a lot of town
usually people do not care about anything
i mean do not get me wrong
these people be weirdoes but -PRON- 're weirdoes who care
excuse me everyone
i realize thing have get a little out of control and that ' ben 's fault and -PRON- ' sorry
but i have an idea and if you like it i think we can end this right now
dear pawnee of the future congratulation

oh i know this one
they be all rappists
oh my god

$ 200 $ 300 million
right

you know i be 24 when gayle take my virginity

you know what i should do
i should lead a teen abstinence workshop
that may be incredibly effective
hey tom
one second
-PRON- be just in the middle of a head massage
well that ' a good stopping point
what ' up
uh you wanna bounce some idea off each other
here ' a good idea
how about i bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little season six of top chef
all right
i know leslie seem upset
but the truth be -PRON- ' good than us at this stuff by a thousand mile
so there ' really no point
care for some fondue

now -PRON- 're gon na seal the deal
-PRON- ' the chance -PRON- have be wait for

there ' a small park on the line between pawnee and eagleton and last night eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting pawnee hobos off their precious land
there ' even a security guard
you get to show eagleton i.d. to get in
eagleton be a bunch of rich snob
and that ' come from someone who have a mercedes
with a harman kardon logic who build a fence to keep kid out of a playground
three word lindsay carlisle shay
who
lindsay carlisle shay and i use to be good friend
we work together at the pawnee parks department
then she go to work in eagleton and fix her deviate septum and lose 35 pound and lose something else
what be it again
oh yeah
her soul
be the eagleton side really that much good than the pawnee side
to be fair yeah
our side be this scrappy piece of land where kid go to smash fluorescent light tube
but it have a lot of heart
that ' what people always say when something suck
we should stand up for our town okay
pawneeans be just as good as eagletonians although on average we be several inch short and 80 pound heavy

why do not we just set fire to the fence
you know set it ablaze
that ' arson

this ga station be own by mick jagger

look this be a stupid idea but right at this exact second we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it be
you be absolutely right
no thinking just stupid
yes
buddhist feel that human being be unlikely to be reincarnate as human being
so the problem with reincarnation be that you could be reborn as a pretzel
or a socket wrench
ron if you could be reincarnate what would you like to be
socket wrench sound pretty good actually
what religion be i
well -PRON- be a practice none of your bleep business
i think the danger in believe in reincarnation be that you spend so much time try to figure out what -PRON- 're go to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one -PRON- 're in now

you can not just chop up the aspect of a relationship into discrete part and select the one you want like a buffet
why not
because -PRON- ' selfish

-PRON- be sorry leslie
-PRON- be just freak out
the only thing we have leave be work

what do that all mean
i think you know what it mean
yeah
i should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so ben and i can keep work together
that ' almost exactly the opposite of what i mean
no what -PRON- will do be -PRON- will get the neighborhood all rile up and then maybe -PRON- will ask for an environmental impact report-- and then ben and i will work together for at least another year
leslie for god 's sake

-PRON- be not go anywhere and we be gon na debate soon and i need to warn you i know my stuff
so you should toughen up
why be you guy smile
i feel bad
hey quick question
that little girl from your video
oh my god -PRON- ' so cute
do you think you can talk to her and let her do an ad for me
that girl be me as a ten year old
how 'd you do that
maybe you should see one of the other doctor
no
no more doctor
-PRON- 're a bunch of scam artist
they reel you in with the free stuff
next thing you know bam you run into an ambulance
every time
let 's just go home and care for each other
we could buy a sewing kit
you could sew up my lip underneath a bridge somewhere
mmm so romantic
oh sorry i forget
let 's go
all right
do you think sewing kit be cover by insurance
or grocery or like xbox game
what be insurance
i do not know
who care
i will institute a reduction in tax for the small business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business relate development
together we will build a good pawnee
so what -PRON- 're look for here be your overall impression of this candidate
what do you like about her
what do not you like about her
her idea her voice her clothes probably
well my campaign have a little momentum so -PRON- 're try to capitalize on that by do a focus group
some thing be very helpful
other thing be not so helpful
all the thing make me feel a lot of feeling about myself
-PRON- ' kinda short do not you think
aggressively short almost
-PRON- ' like -PRON- ' throw it in my face
insightful
you sir say you would not vote for her correct
yeah
yeah she seem a little uptight
she do not seem like the kind of person you could go bowling with you know
what
that ' ridiculous
i be excellent at bowling
ask ron
leslie i know -PRON- ' tough to hear these thing but just try not to get obsess over one comment
-PRON- 're totally right
-PRON- be not obsess
okay what be you do
-PRON- be just remind myself to tell ron to tell you how good i be at bowling
all right
i actually think that she be smart and -PRON- would vote for her
there you go
although i once know a leslie and uh she be just awful
so now i hate all leslies
would she consider change her name
okay here we go
a strong command of the issue
that be good but only 33% say that they would consider voting for you
mm yeah that ' really interesting stuff
why do that guy say that he would not want to go bowling with me
you really have to let that go
-PRON- have never be very good at let thing go
i can not tell you how many time a fun tug of war with a dog over a chew toy turn contentious
one of us always end up mad
i do some research too about the guy who say the thing about me and bowling and his name be derek
oh my god
and get this -PRON- ' not even that good of a bowler
his average be 132 accord to the most recent available datum
leslie that comment be not really about whether -PRON- 're good at bowling which i be
ask ron
which we all know you be
but some people have the impression that -PRON- 're a little elitist or intellectual or something
that be so sexist
-PRON- ' just because -PRON- be a woman
would they deign to say such thing to woodrow wilson or benjamin disraeli okay i see what -PRON- 're talk about
see a lot of people do not vote with their brain
they vote with their gut
i know -PRON- 're fun and you can have a good time
the public need to see that
well then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night
hmm
it would be lay back
everyone have fun great photo op
that could actually work
also -PRON- be really good at bowling
no i do not think i believe you
be there anyone i can ask
yeah
ask ron
oh okay
-PRON- 're kid

oh campaign
take it
excuse me
if the bread and breakfast
this be leslie
this be the final word with perd with your host perderick l. hapley
issue number one be the first issue -PRON- 're go to talk about
be bobby newport 's campaign for city council in trouble
when i say your name i want you to respond
dylan
well newport 's poll number have be plummet
they just fire his campaign manager and where ' bobby
-PRON- ' on vacation in spain
-PRON- ' not on vacation -PRON- ' in hiding
every time the guy speak he put his foot in his mouth
that ' a hilarious image
a foot in a mouth
-PRON- ' a common expression
okay
accord to the new poll leslie knope be now in second place
-PRON- ' just 15 point back
whoa yeah
how do she close the gap
you have to give a lot of credit to her campaign manager ben wyatt
so apparently newport just fire his campaign manager because ben be kick his as
ben be the good campaign manager anyone could ever have
every move -PRON- ' make have work
-PRON- ' like a brilliant sexy little hummingbird
what do you just say
nothing
keep up the good work
-PRON- 're do great
senior citizen be basically the only people who vote in local election so if you want to win you get ta get the gray vote
and to get the gray vote you need to get the endorsement of ned jones
-PRON- ' the president of pawnee seniors united
-PRON- ' like the godfather but old
-PRON- ' like the grandfather
the grand godfather
the grond father -PRON- ' like--
it do not matter
-PRON- ' important and -PRON- ' old
mr. jones such a pleasure to meet you
please do not get up
do not worry
i ca n't
oh
just joke
i can get up
but -PRON- ' difficult
but i can do it but it be hard
look i do not have a lot of time
oh god
-PRON- be so sorry
be it cancer
no i do not have a lot of time before my swim aerobics
oh
why be you better for senior than bobby newport
three word ramp up pawnee
pawnee be way behind the time in term of make its building wheelchair accessible
not enough ramp be the number three complaint among pawnee senior right behind everything hurt and i 'm die
you want to see me
good god
what the hell be you do
upside down sit ups
great exercise and it literally let me see the world from a different perspective
be not there a man 's gymnasium where you could do that
the world 's my gymnasium ron
but i will stop if it make you uncomfortable
could you hold me while i dismount
thanks so much
you bet
question for you
in a town of this size the parks department traditionally have ten employee
you have only seven
why be that
i work hard to make sure my department be as small and ineffective as possible
the department be so small because leslie knope single handedly do the work of four people
and -PRON- ' already scale back her time
if she win -PRON- will be divide her time between parks and city council
-PRON- be go to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack
no
chris that ' unnecessary
the department be do fine without leslie
then prove it
complete one major project
either we complete a government project which be abhorrent to me or we bring a new person into the department which repulse me to my core
remind me of when my dad make me choose which of my pet calf to slaughter with my own hand for my sixth birthday
i could not choose so i slaughter both of them
and they be delicious
essentially -PRON- 're go to put a ramp on every building in town
like i always say stair be a young man 's game
damn straight
this be very impressive
you know you remind me of my brother
you have the same name leslie
he lose a third of his body in a motorcycle accident
the middle third
but they suture the hell out of him
he's-- -PRON- ' fine now
much short but a good look young flat man
what have you hear about newport 's new campaign manager jennifer barkley
uh who
she want to have a meeting with me at 5:00
i tell her sorry
i do not talk politics after dinner
oh my god newport hire a real washington hotshot
wow
she work with james carville
she run two republican congressional campaign and a senate race
yeah
and check out this picture
-PRON- ' eat egg salad with colin powell
that ' the most impressive thing -PRON- have ever see
why be you smile
why be this terrifying information make you smile
newport 's scared
i mean he must have shell out a fortune to hire her
so what do we do next
-PRON- be go to set up a meeting
i mean we can size her up but more importantly -PRON- will humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you
and -PRON- will do it at jj 's diner
home field advantage
as a candidate i appreciate your strategic mind but as woman all i care about be your slight but powerful body
hello ann perkins

-PRON- ' just do this for the money
she do not even like her own client
this could be the good case scenario for us
or the real good case scenario be if she just take the money and do not even try
tell me a little bit about leslie knope
well perd leslie knope represent everything that be wrong about politics in america
-PRON- ' naive -PRON- ' untested and -PRON- ' an entrenched bureaucrat that ' get the stink of big government all over her
oh god
what
wow strong word from a powerful lady
so i guess we both agree
leslie knope be wrong for pawnee
bad case scenario
bad case scenario
-PRON- be leslie knope and when i grow up i want to be a unicorn princess or a city councilor
wrong
not in my town kid
city council ' a real job for a real adult
-PRON- ' play every hour on every channel
-PRON- ' official
i hate jennifer barkley
when i go to that senior center -PRON- be go to go up onstage and -PRON- be go to viciously attack her
okay do not let barkley knock us off message
we be go there to get ned jones endorsement
and that ' huge
-PRON- 're right
and i should listen to you always because you be a man genius with a taut narrow frame like a sexy elf king
do you wish i be tall or-- what ' go on
nothing
-PRON- 're perfect
okay everyone
so the health department be work on a poster campaign to warn people about disease
now we be go to build a good water fountain for the park
andy be our official water fountain tester

okay
that could work
andy
yeah
thank you andy
ah still good
tom

oh god
so let 's not be surprised if she pick my idea
would you just go dummy
what ' the good kind of water fountain
how about no water fountain
this be the voss water butler by tumi
and only $ 600 a bag
april what ' your idea
to go in that room and finish this book
oh really
yeah
be it good
yeah
-PRON- 're go to stay here and -PRON- 're go to help
donna
do i look like i drink water
yoo hoo
-PRON- be over here
just about to start my presentation
i-- uh oh stair

how do i get from here to there
-PRON- be not a professional mountain climber
-PRON- ' a real problem in our town but not any more thanks to ramp
up pawnee
-PRON- 're go to put ramp in every building in this town because if there ' one thing i believe -PRON- ' that stair be a young man 's game
yeah
ramp be an idiot 's game
this be nothing more than a bad version of bobby newport 's plan
what plan
bobby newport do not have a plan
be somebody just talk about bobby newport 's plan
because ned jones and i would love to share it with you
come on out here ned
ned jones be here
say hello to ned jones
make way for ned jones
why do not we just turn up the pressure
that way you do not have to put your mouth so close
all right here we go
ah stop
honey -PRON- be sorry
that will teach you to pay attention
i have an idea
um i be think what if we do something like this
oh my-- dude what the hell
bobby newport 's plan be call rise up
pawnee
he be go to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town
wow
now you could use a ramp but that seem like a lot of work
bobby newport think that the stair should do the work for you do not you agree
give him a hand
as president of seniors united i endorse bobby newport
-PRON- have start meet with people to fill in for leslie
i have find five candidate -PRON- would like to hire and two -PRON- would like to be lifelong friend with
well you will not be hire anyone because my department be just finish up a major project
incoming
get you
donna do n't
excuse me
help everything -PRON- be wear be suede
everything -PRON- be wear be suede everything -PRON- be wear be suede
excuse me everybody
attention
i think -PRON- will agree that this department could use a little leadership
kamikaze
oh stumble for the first time in month the knope campaign seem to be roll down a ramp to nowhere
we be get our butt kick by a guy who be not even in the country
-PRON- ' make out with some floozy in majorca
sorry i wish i be good at this
then you could be make out with some floozy in majorca
maybe we take the fight to her
i mean i could try to get you on perd 's show and you could tell him how she steal your idea
that sound good
okay -PRON- will just do that
i can call or maybe -PRON- will just go down there
hey
chris want you in his office for the final round of interview
and sorry we goof around so much
normally -PRON- would be very proud of you for what you do
this be a rare example where waste a full day of work be a bad thing
be there really go to be a weird new person in the office
i think so
we may be in for a good old fashioned shake up
jennifer barkley
you two faced carpetbagging-- hi leslie
good to see you
hi nice to see you too
you be a two faced carpet-- you want anything
anything
-PRON- ' on me
everything in this town be so cheap
i would never accept anything from a two faced carpetbagging-- leslie
please
let me get my insult out
-PRON- have be practice it the whole way over here
i sense that -PRON- 're angry
tell me why
because you steal my idea and yours wo not even work
ramp be more practical and -PRON- 're less expensive than lift
my idea be good
oh i do not doubt it
the fact be i do not care
ramp lift your plan my plan-- i do not actually care about any of this
-PRON- be just try to win
look -PRON- ' not personal
i like you
but my job be to beat you
so have a seat
-PRON- will get you some of those waffle you love
how do you know that--
-PRON- ' my job to know
god -PRON- 're good
i know
hi guy
what ' so imporant
well after yesterday 's hand on brainstorming session-- water balloon fight
fair enough
we think we come up with a fountain idea that really work
present the amazing spoutless fountain
huh
what
we just remove the splash guard because if -PRON- ' not there you can not put your mouth on it
well i'll-- -PRON- will try it
i do it
good job babe
simple elegant and cost effective
if your team keep this up i think we can hold off on fill the leslie void
i think ben ' already fill the leslie void
oh
oh
-PRON- will give it up for that
so what ' ben 's next move for you
oh oh -PRON- be not go to tell you that
oh let me guess
um -PRON- 're go to attack me
-PRON- 're go to go on that perm show again so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea be yours
-PRON- ' perd first of all and no
maybe
no
that ' not a terrible idea
no actually it be kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that i steal your idea which you do
which i do everyone ' go to think -PRON- 're a sore loser a goody goody nerd
because you know what people do not care about
they do not care about whose idea be first
they care about whose idea be good
well let 's say that that be our plan which it be n't
mm hmm
okay
what would you do instead
oh leslie
i really should not give you campaign advice
right ah what the hell
if you love chess which i do but you do not have anybody to play against which i do n't then sometimes you just get ta play yourself
you could attack the newport plan for cost too much money
no but that would backfire because then we would just say you can never spend too much on senior of course
you need to beat our idea
come up with something good
i do not know
maybe a free shuttle service for senior
all right that could work
wow
waffle and a cappuccino
gracias marta
jj 's do not have a cappuccino maker
oh it do now
i buy them one
course you do
you talk to barkley without me
i want to tell her what a jerk she be
and then she guess your plan immediately and demolish it
okay as a rule you should not take advice from your opponent 's campaign manager
but what if -PRON- ' right
well what if -PRON- ' a trick
i mean maybe she think our original plan would work and she convince you to use her plan instead because she know that wo not work
or maybe she think that we think that she think that so we wo not do it
but she know that i know that she know that-- -PRON- ' in our head
-PRON- be sorry leslie
-PRON- ' good at this than i be
hey there be no one on earth that i would rather go into battle with than you really
yes
so tell me what do we do my campaign manager
i do not know
okay
-PRON- would like to talk about your future
why be we on this bench
this be weird
you do a great job solve that problem today
the leadership you display have get me thinking-- i do not solve that problem
april do
really
why do she tell me you do
because -PRON- ' april and she do not want you to think that she actually care about something
if -PRON- 're look for someone to help fill in for leslie april ' a pain in the as but -PRON- ' clearly the answer
perhaps -PRON- 're right
should i go
oh -PRON- 're still here
yes
let 's begin the show by start it
now leslie you claim the newport campaign steal one of your idea
well uh they do they steal our idea
we be work on the ramp up pawnee initiative for many week
oh perd
this be politics as usual
the fact be bobby newport 's plan be good for senior good for pawnee
well our plan be more practical and -PRON- ' cheap
there she go again perd
i do not know where she go the first time
bobby newport care about good not cheap for our senior
and our flash poll seem to agree
some 78% of those we survey prefer the newport plan to the knope plan
this be why ned jones have endorse us
let 's get back on track
i just think o opppposition be lose sight of what all this be about
what this be about be pawnee and that be what i care about
what bobby newport care about be romp around on some beach in spain with a floozy
excuse me
oh maybe you have not hear of it
it be not in the new york times or le monde which be what she read
it be in the pawnee paper
bobby newport 's personal life be neither here nor there
-PRON- ' certainly not here
and i think pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stay in the city like i do
well we be go to keep this sececret until we have everything in writing but bobby newport be try to convince a major european company to open up a factory in pawnee
and that woman that he be with be an antiland mine advocate
i do not realize that you be proland mine
i be not here to declare a winner but jennifer be the winner
thank you
now -PRON- ' time to move onto our next segment which be a commercial
i be go to get drunk and then -PRON- be go to order a three course meal where each course be make of dessert
she kick our ass
yeah
how be we go to beat her
i do not know
i mean -PRON- ' like a hurricane
-PRON- ' everywhere

be you familiar with the term
pawnee 's airport be symbolic of the town-- out of touch out of date perhaps lose insignificant and sad
your thought

if you say so
i say -PRON- ' sad
move on
oh my god
if they get together they would make the most beautiful super baby
it would rule us all
but what if super baby become too powerful

now i realize that -PRON- 're draft the new city budget and -PRON- have hear that -PRON- 're plan on reduce the park funding by 8%
councilman pillner that can not happen
-PRON- have get to know the city councilman pretty well because of my campaign

leslie that budget be all but finalize
i love build ship in bottle
when the ship be do i put a cork in it put it on the shelf and i move on

please
okay you get me
-PRON- will find the cut somewhere else
good morning everyone
-PRON- be april ludgate and i will be fill in for leslie while she run for office
so the new emergency protocol for the parks department can be find in your binder
what exactly be the chain of command vis a vis on site response
you know what why do not we just say that whoever get to the emergency first will be in charge
okay so if there ' an explosion say in ramset park and someone from sewage get there first -PRON- would be in charge
i have no idea how terrible leslie 's job be
she refer to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride
-PRON- be not quite sure but tom can answer that if what be you do
just bounce some business idea off russell simmons on twitter
why
all due respect miss ludgate do you even know what -PRON- 're do here
all due respect mr. hamster penis but no i do n't
my last name be guiles
be you sure
because you look like a hamster penis
what about a cologne that can kill spider
ron swanson it be my pleasure to inform you that you be a finalist for the job of assistant city manager
chris i feel i should remind you that i do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist
that say -PRON- would be a fool not to pick me
i will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it mean -PRON- be able to further limit reckless government spending
i mean i have so many idea
some be simple like take down traffic light and eliminate the post office
the big one will be tough like bring all of this crumble to the ground
there be one more step in the vetting process
you and i will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation focus on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra
-PRON- be not sure -PRON- be interested in that
no i be sure
i be not interested in that
ron you and i be very different people and we have often be at odds
it be crucial that you and i spend a day spiritually engage and consider what it would really mean to work together
trust me -PRON- will love it
-PRON- will see you tomorrow
oh wear your yoga pant
okay i really wish we would've talk about this first
what could possibly be wrong about me save the parks department budget
i do not know
that ' the point
-PRON- 're think like a parks department employee not a city council candidate
-PRON- 're in a campaign literally
everything you do right now be politics
oh really
be this politics
ow
what be what be that
what why do you do that -PRON- be in a good mood
because the city councilor listen to me
it mean i have some juice
look this may be a good thing
but there ' a reason we strategize before we make decision
okay
okay
-PRON- will make some call see where we be
enjoy the view
what be go on
-PRON- be just really into you
gimme a spin baby
i hate do leslie 's job
-PRON- be fill in for a person who smile 90% of the time
tom can you please help me
please
or just do it
come on lil sparkle
do not give up
what do leslie always say
i do not know weird stuff about waffle
she say you get out of a job what you put into it
you just need to find a project -PRON- 're passionate about
for instance i be incredible at name drink at the snakehole lounge because i care a great deal about signature beverage
the beer yonce knowles
-PRON- ' just a regular beer but we put it in a sexy as mug
pair nicely with the jay zima
we buy a bunch of zima when the factory shut down
that sound fun
maybe i should work at a bar
come on there must be some aspect of this job you care about
hello
here be some paper leslie request
these be blank
weird
as long as -PRON- be here can i ask you a question
do you ever participate in meditation with chris
oh yeah
when we date he make me do it every week
what be i in for here
okay here ' the deal
-PRON- ' crazy boring it last forever -PRON- 're gon na wish you be dead
do you wanna borrow my yoga pant
hey
so do pillner finalize the budget
be we okay
we be the opposite of okay
what do you mean
to keep the money in parks -PRON- 're gon na shut down the westside animal shelter
the money have to come from somewhere and the shelter be on its last leg
so -PRON- 're close it at the end of the week
that ' where champion come from
what will happen to all the other animal

well -PRON- will be fine
no
-PRON- will be no
guy
apparently leslie knope wield her insider influence and get councilman pillner to save her precious department even though it mean close the shelter
now i be not say that leslie knope be a dog murderer per se i just think that her action raise some question
like for example be she a dog murderer
god
well i do not know the answer to that jennifer but your tone make me think yes
say your good bye pebble 'cause weswie knope gon na kill you
she get the perfect puppy for that shot
she be good
leslie there be a woman on the phone that say her daughter 's scared to go to sleep because leslie knope ' go to come murder her kitty
okay we can fix this
yes we can
tomorrow morning we be go back to pillner and tell him to cut the parks budget
no no no no
we can figure something else out
leslie
hey honey good morning
how do you sleep
i adopt 32 cat and dog
do you want pancake
-PRON- be gon na make pancake
be that a pig

which one
be that a pig
you talk about this one
this one right here
yes that be a pig
this be the good meditation center in the area
it do not look like much
actually this strip mall have surprisingly decent chi
although the smell from the greek restaurant next door be not ideal
but through this door lie a deep serene quietude
excuse me lady
on your right
after you ron
now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit
now quietly sit behind me and let 's join breath
-PRON- will stand
interesting technique
andy look at this little guy
-PRON- ' such a little runt
hey there
hey tom look
oh i just have five cat on me at once
you wanna come in here and try to break my record
that ' okay andy i think -PRON- be gon na keep my distance
do not want none of that animal dander interact with this cashmere
what ' your endgame here my dear
this be only temporary until i find a way to keep the shelter open without cut the parks budget
hey what if i throw together a pet adoption in one of our park would that be cool
april that would be the cool thing since n sync aerosmith and nelly perform together at the super bowl halftime show
ew
i think i may have find a project -PRON- would actually enjoy do help these cat and dog
they should be reward for not be people
i hate people
-PRON- be very proud of you april
meanwhile you and i be gon na look at the town budget and -PRON- 're gon na find something expendable
hey ben the pig eat your noise cancel headphone
pig be awesome
all tell we be in there about six hour
and no i be not meditate
i just stand there quietly breathe
there be no thought in my head whatsoever
my mind be blank
i do not know what the hell these other crackpot be do
jerry the puppy be go to the bathroom everywhere
we can not let people see that
i need you to continuously clean out the cage okay
you get it bos
thank you
donna do you put the info sheet on all the cage

all the animal be up to date on their shot
and i think he like you

-PRON- ' pretty awesome
do you know his great grandfather be spuds mackenzie
what do you think sweetie

realistically -PRON- be guess we drop three to five point in the poll
this late in the game -PRON- ' killer
and that ' a dog biscuit
andy put them on the table 'cause he want to try to have the dog play poker
okay leslie we be out of time
we have to go back to them
oh my god
this be it
hmm
oh for god 's sake leslie
there ' just not enough money to do all the thing you wanna do
-PRON- 're try to fit two ship into one bottle
take it from me you can not do that
okay just look at this
there be three employee designate as d1 or on retainer
public works be still pay them even though they haven't work in two year
-PRON- ' an oversight
we get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operate while still maintain the parks budget
interesting
look like we find a big bottle
i know -PRON- 're just make a joke but use a big bottle would be consider cheating by most of our major trade publication
fyi
ron -PRON- have radiate mindfulness
what be you think about
i be not think at all
incredible
it take a ton of work for me to get to that kind of a clear head space no matter how hard i try
do not try so hard
do not try so hard
ron -PRON- be go to try your not try method right here right now
chris wait
i know this crap be important to you so i should come clean
i get nothing out of that experience at all
so if -PRON- 're look for someone who enjoy meditation
oh i do not expect you to enjoy it
my one reservation about you as a co worker be that you seem inflexible
and merely by agree to an activity -PRON- 're not interested in you show flexibility
ron -PRON- have get the job
you wanna head back
i do
but first there ' a hot spin cone of meat in that greek restaurant next door
i do not know what it be but -PRON- would like to eat the whole thing
why be it so dead
where be everyone
do not give up yet
there ' a few minute leave
be this where we drop off our unwanted cat
no
-PRON- ' the opposite
okay
-PRON- be just gon na put these here for a second
and then uh we end up with more animal than we start with
this be what happen when you try
all of these animal be gon na die
god
i hope -PRON- 're happy stupid people in this stupid town
hey
hey you
get back here and get your bleep cat out of there
do you think barack and michelle obama feel like this at the end of the day
probably
i mean i do not know how else wait a second
be that so be i michelle
hey how be everyone

we save the animal shelter and the parks budget
that ' great news
let me guess
you find room in other part of the budget somewhere
totally
get rid of a bunch of lame as d1 's from public works
awesome news
hey you know what else be pretty neat be thanks to you councilman pillner go through the budget and decide that not just public works but all d1 's will be terminate in two week
-PRON- be get fire
ba what now
oh
councilman houser i be just look for you
i have find my assistant city manager
you wanna guess who it be
-PRON- ' ron swanson
-PRON- be sorry
i should have let you guess
-PRON- be just so excited
-PRON- would put a pin in this for now
why
why pin it
the council vote be three to two in favor of another term for you
but one of the yes vote be retire
if bobby newport win -PRON- ' gon na try to bring in his own guy
why would he do that
-PRON- ' not exactly thrill -PRON- have be volunteer for the knope campaign in your spare time
sorry chris
if newport win -PRON- 're go
i just need one more week
and then i think
sorry could you please be careful
oh i be always careful
-PRON- 're good
if i could just get a little bit more time i could figure out how to fix this
unfortunately i can not give you any more time
with due respect leslie i be retire at the end of this term so -PRON- have be fine with you guy push me around on this budget thing
but if -PRON- 're ever gon na hold this job there ' something you need to understand
city council be not about make everybody in town happy
in fact every decision you make be gon na make a lot of people very unhappy
we play with live ammo around here
now -PRON- be gon na close the book on this budget draft by the end of the business day
so if you can find some way out of this mess by 5:00 p.m. you let me know
thank you
that ' fair
i do it
i get it out
oh geez
you do not take the ship out
here you go
chris
great news
i find a way to reduce government spending by 85%
here ' a hint no more department
ha that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait
turn out that bobby newport if he beat leslie be go to appoint his own city manager
so i may have offer you a job that i have no authority to offer
-PRON- be so so sorry
well that be disappointing
but do not worry about me
-PRON- will be fine
oh i know
i mean in the grand scheme of thing who care
-PRON- 're all just molecule float around in random pattern devoid of meaning
well -PRON- will see you when i see you
-PRON- be a roll stone
peace
stop
have a seat
we do thing your way now -PRON- 're gon na do it my way
prepare to experience true freedom and bliss
oh maybe i should just go back to be a nurse full time
no i will not let you return to a life of shave wiener and dodge knife attack from meth head

-PRON- be nervous
gah
i guess i want to do a good job because um i like it when people think i do a good job
and i want your vote because i want pawnee and my dad to see what -PRON- be make of
so let 's do this
the wreck crew
who let you guy in
hey jason
ease back
this question about public safety come from twitter because apparently that ' something that happen now @munchmeat2015
ask pawnee use 2 b safe
some1 steal my car
what will u do 2 make pawnee safe can u help me find my car
i can assure you if you have a gun mount on the dashboard which automatically shoot people try to break into it you would still have your car
you know i guess i would like to tell mr. munchmeat that i think that stink that happen to him
you know one time a guy steal some downhill ski out of my jeep
and i be so mad i punch a mailbox
-PRON- be against crime and -PRON- be not ashamed to admit it
i can not get through to the cable company
can you do something
like what
anything
andy 's just act out scene from his favorite movie
so swayze run boom
tackle the guy off the motorcycle
dude 's like you 're dead bro
come at him
swayze duck scissor kick
sha
the guy have swayze 's head
and he say i use to bleep guy like you in prison
by the look of this guy this be not consensual sex -PRON- 're talk about
we see bad guy have a gun the whole time
-PRON- ' like -PRON- 'm a kill you the old fashioned way
swayze 's like not this time
that ' subtext
he do not say that
bypass the gun hook the arm
back to the secret move he use before to kill somebody he feel so bad about it
but this time he have to do it because -PRON- ' self defense
k k k kah
take the esophagus out of the neck area
you can not eat
-PRON- will starve to death
and that be road house
what should i do next
leslie knope
this question be about pawnee 's park system
why be ramsett park so filthy and awful
-PRON- ' difficult to get into the complicated problem with ramsett park in such a short amount of time
you have 20 second
oh my god okay
i will say that the park in pawnee-- i do have an update on your time allotment and that update be that your time be almost go
i have no more time leave
well you have some time when i start talk but by the time i finish your time be up
thank you very much
-PRON- ' off her game
-PRON- ' fine
mr. newport rebuttal
i know this
if something be dirty we should clean it up
let 's start there
right
you know what i have this clean lady name yolanda who be very wise
she basically raise me
and one day she say little bobby -PRON- be not go to clean your room no ma
and from that day on my room be gross
really bum me out
i think we should make our park look like my room after yolanda finally you know give in and clean it up for me
if i may joan
that ' a very sweet story bobby but not all of us have yolandas who can clean up our room for us
some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeve and do the hard work yourself
-PRON- would just like to say that like leslie i do not have people do my work for me
leslie and i do our work ourselves
my work of course be have sex with man and woman on camera
once again brandi and leslie be essentially the same person
but bobby newport be super handsome and charming so that mean people will probably vote for him because there ' no justice in the world
how do you respond to newport 's claim that the city park need to be clean up
leslie knope work tirelessly every day so our park can be the good they can be
our park pristine
and we all know the better look a park be the more attention it will get from lady park who want to have sex with it
excuse us
what the hell be wrong with you
-PRON- 're fight for our life out there
oh i do not know
maybe the fact that we just break up and -PRON- 're already rid the traeger train
what be you talk about
i see you guy get back together
what about us
what about us tom
-PRON- 're not together any more because you keep act like an as
-PRON- be sorry
i just act that way sometimes because -PRON- be nervous and i feel like -PRON- 're out of my league
but -PRON- would do anything to get back together with you
please
vote for me to be your boyfriend
ben -PRON- ' win
how be he win
everything -PRON- ' say be nonsense and -PRON- ' fool them
okay -PRON- 're do fine
i need to go back on the attack
no
no no no no no
see okay
when you attack you kind of come off like a bully and he look sympathetic so you know y you do a really good job of ease off
leslie this be fun be not it
yeah
well there ' no reason on earth that i can think of that we should not have concussion grenade in our nation 's movie theater
by the year 2013 we will have a fully functional mall on jupiter
sure i agree that movie should be more faithful to the book that they be base on but what do that have to do with this election
all my movie be base on book
and anyone who even rub their hand on a leather jacket should be try for murder
-PRON- be an american
my father be an american
my mother be an american
my godfather be the viceroy of the principality of liechtenstein
once again people grenade launcher
daniel craig
no timothy dalton
i be in favor of close the border bookstore not the border to mexico
i guess my thought on abortion be you know let 's just all have a good time
i do not care about that issue
just ask someone else
for the record -PRON- would appear in a film with any of my fellow candidate
anteaters
kill shoot
money shot
fudgsicles
let 's spend our money on what matter
police fire park and school
after a rough start your girl 's do okay
um i think -PRON- ' do a little good than okay
or do you miss the applause she get on the raccoon safety question
oh that be great
that probably pull her even with bobby
i can not believe -PRON- 're so casual about this
do not you even want to win the debate
oh -PRON- 're gon na win the debate
get an ace in the hole
little surprisey wisey
what
oh -PRON- will see
hey quick question
do that guy chris traeger have a girlfriend and be his penis normal
stop talk
you guy uh know anything about a guy name john rambo
open on villager be throw out into a rice field
land mine blow them up into piece
after i steal this cable feed i will repay the cable company for the service we use
this last question before the break be for mr. newport
uh some not me have criticize your involvement with your father 's candy company sweetums
would your affiliation with big business affect your decision as a city councilor
i want to run this town like a business
my opponent leslie knope have a very anti business agenda
recently my dad tell me that if leslie knope win the election -PRON- will probably have to move sweetums to mexico
that would be terrible of course
thousand of people in this town would lose their job and we all would not have candy
now -PRON- be not say that be gon na happen but i do know this
if i win i bet i could get them to stay
wow
shock stuff
-PRON- 're gon na be back with our closing statement right after a word from our sponsor sweetums pawnee 's big supplier of candy and job
stick around
so sweetums be gon na move to mexico if bobby do not win
how could they do that to this town
what a crappy stunt to pull

one minute back
what do we do
i think we attack him
-PRON- ' more confident now
i have to attack him
and say what
we do not plan for this
what would you even say
i do not know
-PRON- will figure out as -PRON- be say it
just let me attack him
i want to attack him
no no no no
-PRON- ' too risky
just go with the close statement we rehearse
add a line at the end about how -PRON- 're pro business and -PRON- will deal with the fallout tomorrow okay
what
what ' the matter with you
i can do it
i can crush him
i promise
ah screw it
go get him
really
kick his as
i be lineman for the county and the wichita lineman
be still the line
the final thing these candidate will say be their closing statement
we will begin with our first candidate to go bobby newport

-PRON- ' on
and leslie knope close statement
-PRON- be very angry
-PRON- be angry that bobby newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you do not give him what he want
-PRON- ' despicable
corporation be not allow to dictate what a city need
that power belong to the people
bobby newport and his daddy would like you to think it belong to them
i love this town
and when you love something you do not threaten it
you do not punish it
you fight for it
you take care of it
you put it first
as your city councilor i will make sure that no one take advantage of pawnee
if i seem too passionate -PRON- ' because i care

any question

at the 11th hour the newports be try to install these vote machine at several precinct around town

-PRON- be sorry

ms. pinewood recently many of the local restaurant have change their small size option to a whopping 64-ounce

then there be a horrifying that the call child size
how be this a child size soda

-PRON- ' a real bargain at $ 1.59
-PRON- be sorry ms. pinewood but why would anybody need this much soda

-PRON- ' a real idea
so get this-- kid be always grow out of their clothes so their parent do not want to buy 'em nice thing
-PRON- be gon na rend my upscale clothing to middle school kid because i discover -PRON- be roughly the same size as the average pawnee 12-year old
that ' actually a really great idea
i know
can you take a look at the business plan tell me what do you think
sure
why not
awesome
washington d.c. have more dog park per caput than most city
pawnee only have two dog parks-- this one and that one which be also an active parking lot
can you say per caput again
i want to take a picture of you say per caput
stop
i be so proud of you
now stand next to the screen and think about all the strong female role model in your life
gross
april come to me with an idea to build a dog park in pawnee
i recognize her potential a long time ago and -PRON- ' finally live up to it
i mean i be so proud of her i could cry
and here we go
one tiny critique
if you do want to be take seriously you may want to think a little bit about how you present yourself
no this be publicity for orin 's new performance art show
-PRON- ' an animal live on a human farm
and you can go and fee him from your own hand
ugh that ' horrifying and so be orin
you should not be friend with him
so after review all the option i find that the good location for the dog park be lot 48 the one behind ann 's house
no
no no no no no no
-PRON- have be try to put a park there for four year
see the thing be april that lot be mine
-PRON- have be do slow painstaking work
so i do not want to whip out the legalese on you now but i get dibs
what we be gon na do be -PRON- 're gon na take your enthusiasm -PRON- 're gon na bundle it up and -PRON- 're gon na find a new place for a dog park
do not that sound fun
one two three cheese
good girl
good morning andy

aha
-PRON- ' go
a game be the foot
see part of the police academy entrance exam be investigate a crime

i take my talent to south beach
how do you spend your time in miami
maybe fence steal computer

your mission statement make sense and you do not use one r. kelly lyric
yes
so you want to be my cfo
well i already have a job but -PRON- will help as a friend
as long as you take what i say seriously
i do not want another entertainment 720 disaster on our hand
yeah it be a disaster
too bad we do not see it come
all right what ' my first move
you know i think any of the four previous location would work but there ' something about this place
it just have a really good energy here you know
lot of natural light
-PRON- ' tiny and awful and loud
and -PRON- ' zone 14b industrial waste clean up site
we should technically be wear hazmat suit right now
it seem like the kind of place a ska band would go to shoot heroin
come on guy this be a great place for a dog park
i mean look there ' already a dog here
oh my god
i have that exact doll when i be a kid
this is-- this be traumatic for me
well -PRON- be sorry but lot 48 be the only one that work

what ' his deal
-PRON- ' new
he use to be a slacker but now -PRON- ' realize his full potential but at what cost
-PRON- ' smart and -PRON- ' beautiful and i think of him in many way as a daughter but that would be crazy 'cause -PRON- ' a man and his name ' ricky
here ' my question
how do you use to slow me down when i be become too me ish
sometimes -PRON- would just give you busy work
i once have you put together a brochure about different kind of indiana topsoil
that soil brochure be not busy work
i mean people still refer to mulch ado
about nothing
and if you be particularly amped up about a project -PRON- would take you to jj 's and distract you with waffle
those be distraction waffle
i think they be friendship waffle
breakfast food can serve many purpose
but what if this person this ricky who be real do not like waffle or anything
everybody have something -PRON- 're passionate about
just figure out what it be express an interest in it and divert his attention
howdy neighbor

-PRON- 're just gon na fill out this stupid report and that ' it
as a future cop you have to understand i can not let this guy go
look man
this be what most police work be
just write stuff down
-PRON- ' not superhero time
if it sound boring maybe you ought to do something else
maybe we should find the person who steal his positive attitude
hey man
hey man
get any more job offer since i last see you
yeah but it be just a management position at urban outfitters
i turn it down
i do not know man
maybe i can not hack this
maybe i should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job
well my accounting job be not bore
if it be remotely interesting there would be a show on a&e about it
they have a show about storage unit auction
fair point
look if -PRON- 're passionate about this keep at it
thing will turn around
also can you tell me what time that show about storage unit be on
all right -PRON- be gon na have to force this
leslie maybe you want to admit that you haven't be the great role model

i do not care if -PRON- ' some junkie war criminal pimp
i be not gon na change my mind
his name ' wreston st. james
-PRON- ' from eagleton
oh -PRON- have change my mind
-PRON- be not be melodramatic when i say that people from eagleton be snobby and evil and they look down on pawnee and they would most likely exterminate everyone who be not from eagleton if they be not so busy be obsess with themselves
god that be close
sometimes when i rant about eagleton i forget to breathe and i pass out
no
we can not have someone from eagleton design a park for pawnee
we have have a blood feud that have last for 200 year
well we do not have a lot of time and he be the first decent candidate
so let 's at least go meet the guy
yeah that ' a good idea
then we can reject him face to face
i like your plan
friend former lover acquaintance jerry i introduce you to the future home of rent a swag
yikes
much like woman in 90s stand up comedy routine tommy be shop
i start a business where i rend my fancy clothes to teen so their parent do not have to buy them nice thing -PRON- will just grow out of

help
the place need some work but this be a great location
lot of foot traffic no metered parking

ben
leslie
hi
hi
wreston st. james
thank you so much for come

in a word underwhelming
and a little inconvenient
there ' no trash can anywhere
what be i suppose to do with my garbage just throw it on the ground
oh hey
thank you for the trash
mr. st. james i have to say this park be incredible
thank you
its official name be five mile grounds but we like to call it wide smile abound
because of all the smile that occur
-PRON- ' so boring
come on -PRON- will take you guy on a little tour
great
he seem super cool
he seem cool
just you wait
well they always wine and dine you first but the fact of the matter be eagletonians be without exception snobby condescend jerk
this be the pawnee side of our border with eagleton
and this be the eagleton side
ah

-PRON- ' only be 15 second
ohh
oh babe thank god -PRON- 're here
i get so bored
i start think about existence-- do i matter

just dumb stuff like that
ugh
who care
i think be a security guard would be exciting
nope
wait a minute
be not this how all great bert macklin case start
-PRON- ' quiet
a little too quiet
as you can see we like to keep thing quite immaculate
i remember when pawnee have that massive sewage overflow in circle park-- whatever happen with that
we totally fix it
well except for the smell
the scientist think -PRON- ' go to linger for another 40 year
can we just cut to the chase here
why would a fancy eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny pawnee park
well i hear your plea on the radio and you be so passionate about the project
it do not matter if -PRON- ' a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park
-PRON- ' about the people
-PRON- 're here to serve them
hey mr. st. james
oh our balloon artisan be out of balloon
excuse me
i have chill
look at my arm
why be you so charmed by him
-PRON- 're like a southern belle when rhett butler come around
yes
rhett butler
that ' who he remind me of
or bono
what
no one from eagleton have ever want to help anyone from pawnee for any reason
in 1988 we be hit by a tornado
we ask eagleton for help and they claim they be not home
an entire town claim they be not home
i do not trust that guy for a second

we owe them a debt of gratitude
mm
june 1817 the rich among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like coward to form eagleton

i will have oatmeal and berry
and i will have catfish and grit with pumpernickel toast
explain
well instead of get sweep up in my boyfriend personality i be date myself and try new thing
so every time i go out to eat i order one thing that ' typical me and then something that i would never order
now i have two good friend ann and ann
each one more beautiful than the other
oh i also have be document all the new thing -PRON- be try on my blog
check this out
i go skydiving
which ann be scream like a maniac
oatmeal ann or catfish ann
-PRON- be not sure because i instantly black out from extreme terror
hey i have an idea for your blog
i think you should take yourself ice skating
that sound fun
yeah -PRON- will do a double date you and you and me and ben
but i have to warn you -PRON- be very good at ice skating
i can do jump
you know what
i probably should not come
-PRON- will embarrass the both of you
actually i know what my next activity be gon na be
and -PRON- ' a biggie
i want to be a mom
-PRON- be go to the sperm bank today
can you come
wow today
ann you know that i fully support any woman 's decision-- especially a beautiful unicorn nurse like yourself-- in create the family that she want
but you be so brilliant and kind and stupid hot
i mean -PRON- 're definitely gon na find a wonderful guy who love you and respect you and fill your home with multi ethnic genius baby
maybe or maybe not
you hit the lottery with ben and that ' great but not everybody ' so lucky
-PRON- have want to be a mom for a long time -PRON- be ready and i think -PRON- would be good at it
ann be give up on love and decide to have a baby with herself
and she have only be date herself for six week
if she be date a guy for six week and they decide to have a kid -PRON- would be like
congratulation ann and channing tatum

because that be the only scenario that would make sense to me
what a gorgeous herbaceous medley
there ' be a mistake
-PRON- have accidentally give me the food that my food eat
salad be traditionally the first course at a wedding
be a gerbil marry a rabbit
-PRON- be in charge of food for the wedding
so i bring in pawnee 's three good caterer and a panel of expert
chris love vegetable
ron love meat
and tom consider himself a foodie which apparently mean take instagrams of food instead of eat it
okay so i like number one chris like number two and ron like number three
tom what about you
caterer number one 's presentation be simple mm yet exhaust
number two 's be subtle and provocative like a coy dutch woman guard a dark secret
nothing -PRON- 're say be helpful
but number three 's tell a story-- a story from a book i would not read but i would watch the movie of
that ' nonsense
you know what
-PRON- be gon na go with the first place
i really love that appetizer
oh the mini calzone
i would not call it that
it be more like a savory pastry
delicate little dough pocket fill with tomato sauce cheese and seasoned meat
just a stunning culinary innovation
it be a calzone
it be literally just a small calzone
let me just get some detail for your file
now be you two a couple
no
tragically we be both heterosexual
so ann what be you look for in particular
some sperm
i mean in term of a donor
oh you know nice guy nice sperm
flip through this binder make a note of anyone who interest you and -PRON- will be back shortly
oh
this guy go to harvard
so do the unabomber
this guy seem healthy
love cycling
yeah so do lance armstrong and he turn out to be a lie drug user
or a hero
i do not know where we stand on him now
hello lady
fancy meet you here
whoa sewage joe
wow
ann you remember joe fantringham
he be the gentleman who be fire for email a picture of his penis to every woman in city hall
guilty
yeah that ' what the judge say
mmhmm
joe you be a donor here huh
do you hear that ann
big time me and all my buddy
free money free porn
good job i ever have
also if -PRON- 're look to buy some weed -PRON- be look as well
shall we
yup
okay leslie knope outfit number eight
babe you look super hot
you realize -PRON- have say that about all of them
well she have every single time
'cause she be super hot
honestly -PRON- would look hot naked
ugh
this suit make me want to scold a catholic child
i do not know who ann taylor be but i hate her and i want to kill her
i have to lead a public forum for the pawnee commons every day this week and i hate talk to people
so to get through it i figure -PRON- be just gon na basically try to imitate leslie
she still wear this
she have the patch sew in
you can not remove it
what ' in the pocket you ask
a ticket stub from a fleetwood mac concert in 1995 and this one be terrible but it be slightly less terrible than the rest
so tomorrow i lead a public forum in leslie 's fleetwood mac sex pant
fleetwood mac sex pants
new band name
i call it
ooh you know what
maybe just fleetwood mac
so what ' the next move
be there like a good sperm bank in eagleton or something
um you do not want a demon baby
look -PRON- 're ann perkins
sperm that be worthy of your perfect egg do not grow on tree
i think ideally -PRON- would want to know the guy right
-PRON- would want to know his personality his favorite season of friends whether or not he hat jazz-- hopefully he do
-PRON- would want to know him
yes leslie -PRON- 're totally right
-PRON- be gon na go home and -PRON- be gon na make a list of all the guy i already know who could be donor
and then -PRON- be gon na call them and tell them -PRON- be do some blog entry on man 's health or something
i can interview them and ask them whatever i want
-PRON- 're a genius
this be your idea and i love it
-PRON- will call you later
no
if i do not slow this baby train down ann may end up have a baby with some random weirdo instead of her soul mate
i fully believe that a woman should be in charge of what happen to her body
in this case the body be ann 's and the woman in charge of it be me
i be up all night brainstorming and this be the complete official list of candidate for ann 's baby daddy
wow how do you come up with these three name
well i eliminate everyone in a relationship and the obvious no s like knuckle hair dave from hr
i do not mind the knuckle hair

i have to tell you a secret

good morning april
what ' your secret
-PRON- be think about apply to veterinary school in bloomington

and -PRON- be go to use it to crush her into be nice to me
i would be happy to write you that letter
i actually know the guy who run the veterinary program over there
because you hook up with him
i do not hook up with everyone i know

so i have to be your slave or something
no you have to be my friend
no that be so much bad
do not do that
i think i have a plan of how to save your store
if we get the pawnee historical society to declare your store as a historical landmark then you may get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat
that sound like the government meddle in private enterprise
well ron we all know how much you love the free market
but the pawnee videodome be the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual
that and the slam poetry night at beanie 's coffee

-PRON- ' pointless

andy
that ' my husband
they be still extremely graphic and appreciate by all of us
i have never hear of several of those term and -PRON- be a freak
those be personal
no one 's allow to read those
you once post a video of yourself drink alcohol in city hall while you be still a minor
how do you justify that
easily
alcohol be delicious and fun damentally a substance that should not be abuse
i agree april
very good point
wow
ms. ludgate be you a ventriloquist
i mean that be amazing how you make your word come out of ms. knope 's mouth
would you like to put her on your knee
i mean that 'd be really fun
just three year ago you
drove-- -PRON- ' not ready
now -PRON- have rush her into this and now jamm 's sharpen the knife
leslie no one need to be jam today
okay all we need be some kind of distraction
grab that gavel and break your other foot
i like the idea of double the signing but i think the negative outweigh the positive
do not panic
maybe she can pull this off
i guess my first move as director would be to fill your office house and car with snake and then train a crow to fly up your butt
okay
let 's take a brief recess
well well well look who ' back
thank you so much for see us again sir
we just come to apologize
mr. dennis feinstein let me just say from the bottom of my heart my bad
i just start work here and i really want to do a good job and i blow it
thank you for say that
thought about it last night and i decide that if you come in here and apologize to me like a man that i would forgive you and that ' what -PRON- have do so -PRON- 're forgive
to that end here be a check for $ 25,000 for your charity
oh go out there and help some kid with their pink eye or whatever it be you guy be do
mr. feinstein thank you
this be extremely generous
-PRON- ' nothing really
-PRON- be happy to help
this check be make out to go bleep yourself

in your face dennis feinstein help no man
get the hell out of my office

guy guy just hold it-- hold on a sec okay
mr. feinstein with all due respect you be a major dick
what
run
eddie get my crossbow

you will pay for this
hey you look good
i guess actual medicine can be effective
who'da thunk
please leave me alone
not until we go over your test result and your blood work
your blood pressure look fine
-PRON- be not sure how this be possible but your cholesterol be 120 which be the low -PRON- have ever see
what ' cholesterol
and the only problem i see be that your potassium 's low so just eat a banana once in awhile
no thank you
i live the way i live i eat the thing i eat and -PRON- will die the way -PRON- will die
that ' oddly beautiful but also stupid
-PRON- 're not alone in the world anymore ron
-PRON- 're date a woman who have two kid so every three day think about ivy and zoe and diane and eat a damn banana
i be so sorry april
you be do terribly up there and -PRON- ' all my fault
-PRON- ' not you -PRON- ' me
be you break up with me
-PRON- be break up with the idea of you be director of animal control
i say we just withdraw your application and let vern become director
he do have good tooth
no
all right i have an idea
trust me
ms. ludgate it be the opinion of this committee that you be terrible
can you give me even one reason why -PRON- 're the right man for this job
no
but neither be your guy
neither of us should get the job
oh no
why be that
there should not be a separate animal control department
its budget be tiny and -PRON- ' ineffective and frankly no one could change that
so i think it should be absorb into the parks department
that be a genius idea
somebody wake up milton
history be be make
iwo jima
animal control would be way more effective if it run through the parks department and if you want i can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummy to understand dummy
councilman you have to admit that that idea make a lot of sense
hang on a second
you seem to be forget that i already tell vern he get the job and he already buy a new speedboat
well i hope he keep a receipt
that be a brilliant idea from a dark tortured genius and i move that animal control be absorb into parks and rec
i second that
yay
look at that april
you win over jamm
uh no she do n't
-PRON- be just sick of be on the losing side
-PRON- be go to tell everyone this be my idea
retro jam
what do we do now
can i apologize again
-PRON- be get really at apologize
screw that
you should apologize for apologize to that guy
god we really could have use the money though
just wish -PRON- would make a big impression
you did--
i be really impressed by all the stuff the foundation 's do for all them poor homies so you know what
rend
a swag be gon na donate five cent from every dollar we make this month
-PRON- ' not feinstein money but -PRON- will help
that ' very generous tom
feinstein 's the bad
i hope he get into an accident drive that rolex mobile
for the last time -PRON- ' a rolexus and you can not drive it
april i have a gift for you
ta da
at leslie 's suggestion i have make you deputy director of animal control within the parks department
-PRON- will be amazing at it and the good part there be no confirmation hearing
how do you make this plaque so quickly
i have it make your first week here
i know -PRON- would be go place so i want to be prepared
can i hire an intern not yet
can i hire a mexican elf
no can i buy a child bride
no
then how be this even a promotion
government should not operate base on personal favor
it should operate base on good idea
april have the good idea and today the good idea win
leslie i really have to go to the bathroom
oh yeah right sorry
you do not have to come in with me
i be not go to

do anyone object
as always i object
nay enough dithering
dump the miscreant boo
today be ted party day where we commemorate the great pawnee tea dump of 1817
historical fun fact-- when the found fathers write the charter their old timey script make one of the a"s look like a d so tea become ted
-PRON- ' just one of those little thing that remind us of pawnee 's rich and vibrant past
plus we get to go find a guy name ted and throw him in a lake

and i talk to the other teds in town and -PRON- 're not do it either
come on ted party day be protect by article two in the town charter
and we have the right nay the obligation to dump ted into the lake every year
that ' the way -PRON- ' always be do
okay first of all that ' the way -PRON- ' always be do be not a good reason to keep do something
second it be a misprint
they clearly mean tea
i just think you need to be careful about speculate what the founders mean when they be write the town charter
okay fine
you want to enforce every single old law we have on our book
hey can i see your key for a second
here ' a quarter
i own your car now
wha-- sorry
the pawnee charter clearly state that any white citizen have the right to seize any indian property for 25 cent
that be an outdated and racist law
and obviously they mean american indian
whoa i think we should be careful when we speculate what the founder intend when they write the charter
okay ted
i know what -PRON- 're do
-PRON- 're quote me back to me
but -PRON- be gon na quote me back to you and say that ted party day will never change

but i will do something if it help someone else do nothing
-PRON- would work all night if it mean nothing get do
ron swanson and april ludgate literally my two favorite people in the catalogue universe
april will not be participate in your pointless course because she have more important thing to do like not participate in your pointless course
i just want april to become as great a department head as yourself
which be why this be pointless
-PRON- have be head of the parks department for 12 year and i never have any management training course
ron -PRON- have never be ka tumtsed
i be legally require to ka tumts every department head
otherwise we be open to all kind of liability

i just keep get outbid by someone name tall tie ree on lannister
what kind of name be tie ree on anyway
-PRON- 're kid right
tyrion lannister
lord of casterly rock
the half man
you do not watch game of thrones

hell
yeah
have you see those dothraki dude
they can get it
everybody on that show can get it
i think i know who -PRON- be bid against
i now realize that i be wrong and -PRON- ' time that we purge the book of many of our town 's outdated and obscure law
the bill that i have write with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete law such as all menstruate woman shall be confine to their bathtub and article two aka ted party day
the floor be now open for public comment
oh here we go
thank you
my name be garth blundin and i object to your ridiculous proposal
the pawnee charter shall not be change
not today not ever
wow a lot of passion mr. blundin
thank you so much
your objection be note and officially in the record
shall we proceed to a vote
no
no we shall not
article seven section three allow for a citizen filibuster
if i stand here and refuse to yield my time you be prohibit from vote on the bill
that section define buffalo meat as acceptable currency
be that the buffalo meat one
mm hmm
i mean article three section seven
let the filibuster begin
i would now like to share some idea i have for j.j. abrams seventh chapter in the star wars saga
pan down from the twin sun of tatooine
we be now close on the mouth of the sarlacc pit
after a beat the gloved mandalorian armor gauntlet of boba fett grab onto the sand outside of the sarlacc pit and the feared bounty hunter pull himself from the maw of the sand beast
ugh -PRON- ' right
he can do this
this be exactly why we need to modernize these law
this kind of thing make sense when we have council in a barn and there be but now this be nuts
if he hold the reality gem that mean he can jump from different reality
this will be our link to the marvel universe from the star wars universe
imagine those who be up against chewbacca 'cause that ' gon na happen
after a beat luke say darth vader be my father but ben kenobi be my master
and he cut hannibal lecter in half
mr. blundin look the law -PRON- be try to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and -PRON- 're embarrass to pawnee
repeal them would show that -PRON- 're change with the time
you can not just change the charter willy nilly
you start by casually repeal a couple of old law the next thing you know your jack boot storm trooper be kick in my door and arrest my wife for no reason if i be marry
by jack boot storm trooper do you mean the pawnee police department

the pawnee charter be not a live document ms. knope
you have no respect for the tradition of this town
i absolutely do
i use to give tour at the pawnee historical house
three time employee of the fortnight

oh big deal you put on a costume for a couple hour
by that logic every time i go to bed at night i be wolverine
you buy x men pajama
i win them madam in a raffle
the point be be that our found father be brilliant and they be courageous but they also have wooden tooth and pooped in hole in the ground
it be a more primitive time
it be a good time
you would not have survive two week in their day
oh really
how about a little wager
how about you and i go live in that historical house no modern technology if you last longer i withdraw my bill
i win you stop this nonsense
you have yourself a deal
please write down what you hope to gain from the seminar seal it in the envelope and then -PRON- will open it when -PRON- ' over
when be this over
as soon as you learn to embrace the power of positive motivation
-PRON- ' a nine hour seminar over two day
whoa
oh good
all right let 's begin
hop on board the management train
first stop-- motivation station
all aboard
stop bid on my waffle iron
-PRON- 're futuremrstigerwoods
i make that profile like ten year ago
i do not know how to change it
the point be -PRON- be get that waffle iron for leslie for breakfast day
uh no -PRON- 're not
-PRON- be get it for her for waffle day

mine ' in june
please ben
this be the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hang out at jj 's which she consider the beginning of our friendship

okay tyrion lannister why do not you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back
oh okay

actually -PRON- ' gon na bug me if i do n't
the lannisters while very wealthy do not possess the magical ability of say the warlock of qarth for example
this be why we do not hang out
think of yourself as engineer steer a locomotive of positivity that run on team power
first of all you do not steer a locomotive
the track do
second there be only three way to motivate people-- money fear and hunger
oh i disagree
what about encouragement appreciation and smile
when people feel supported they will literally explode with productivity
can you guy just figure out which way be good and tell me so we can leave
thank you for your input april but the ka tumts require that we follow a very specific syllabus
-PRON- 're not be very inclusive chris
i feel like my input be not be appreciate
-PRON- have kill my spirit

no
i be wonder would you like to join the pawnee historical commission
those clown
no thank you
they haven't answer a single one of my complaint about their anachronistic use
well -PRON- be a member and i think we could really use you
but the only problem be there 's ton of meeting lot of work with people who also love history and many social occasion that -PRON- 're gon na have to attend like cocktail party and such
i can understand if -PRON- ' something you do not want to commit to
just sound like such a big bite out of my soap make time
my cousin 's arraignment be in may.
but that ' a day
i just fly out i come back the same day
on a trial basis yes
yes yes
great
welcome to the team
garth drop his protest and we be able to get rid of all the outdated law in the town charter
i mean the charter be a wonderful document but -PRON- have have the benefit of almost 200 year of learning and advance
seem to me we ought to use it
i do not change article two though
i just could not vote against a good old fashioned lake dunking
though garth and i do come up with a compromise that i think will make everybody happy
from this year hence a volunteer will represent ted in our town 's most historic and cherished tradition
this year the honor go to mr. garth blundin
huzzah -PRON- be ted
-PRON- be ted
-PRON- be ted too guy
andy
yeah
-PRON- ' naked everybody
put that away -PRON- 're all ted
yeah

thank god
i do not know how to swim
okay final tally
jerry file 268 red file
yes
and 384 blue file
yes
wait a minute
how be that possible
well he be so happy when you tell him he be do a great job that he spend 20 minute on the phone tell gayle about it
and the prosecution rest
not so fast
he may have file more blue one but -PRON- 're almost all file wrong
not surprising since he be a mess after you talk to him
another fascinating edition of ka tumts
we may never know conclusively which way work better
but i do know this--
when we first start the seminar i hop to be able to engage you in the process
and by that measure i succeed
and i predict that i would learn nothing from this process
mission accomplish
what do april write
where be april
i will pit ron and chris against each other
-PRON- will argue about dumb stuff that do not matter and i will bail
then -PRON- will steal $ 20 from chris 's wallet and buy pizza with andy
oh and -PRON- will also steal ron 's watch just for fun
i think april will be a fine manager
i agree
-PRON- ' my favorite kind of battle-- two man enter one me leave
happy waffle day
happy breakfast day
oh my god you guy this be the good breakfast day/waffle day joint present i have ever receive
wow
thank you so much
-PRON- 're welcome

we just can not keep up with all the anniversary
-PRON- ' too much especially 'cause -PRON- 're so good at them
-PRON- be no good at them than you be

every year there will be one day ann day where you can celebrate all of ann 's holiday and ben day where we can celebrate all of ours

well yes
i mean the timing be right accord to ann 's ovulation schedule
unless there ' a reason -PRON- would like to wait till next month

here i be think about how fast my first year in city council have go and jerry have have 40 year whiz past him with nothing to show for it
this be everything in his file-- a handicapped parking sticker from when he get gout a parks and rec golf cart drive exam which he fail a scathing performance review
i mean why would anyone be so mean

i stand by it
well jerry be never really the type to rise above mediocrity or to it
that ' what i think but when he start he have a lot of dream and goal
i mean look at his original entry paperwork

oh yeah
he be the mayor at the time
-PRON- have always want to meet him
well today -PRON- 're get that chance
so be he like a really great mayor no not really
he resign because of corruption and racketeering and then he die from an overdose of pill
but actually his real cause of death be be throw out of a helicopter while handcuffed
some people say -PRON- ' still alive because they never find the body but they never find the body because he explode on impact
sound like a good dude
yeah
i just wish i have a chance to meet him you know year ago before all the scandal and his death
but this be nice too
yeah
be it
yes
mm hmm
it be
okay go over there
let 's meet mayor knudson
-PRON- will take your picture
butterfly
hello mr. mayor
first of all -PRON- be so sorry that those serbian mobster shove you out of that helicopter
you deserve good
okay you try but i take a day off to spend with you not with you and jerry and a dead mayor
can we please just call it a day
no we can not because in a few short year -PRON- 're gon na be visit jerry here and he will have achieve nothing
be that what you want
no
okay then
-PRON- ' really be nice to meet you
okay jerry let 's go
ooh
ronfire of the vanity
filo pilo
be you kid me
listen now that jerry 's go we need to hire someone to pick up the slack
a new person in the office
not a person
an intern
why on earth would i get an intern
intern cost nothing to the taxpayer
and more importantly -PRON- 're usually stupid and terrible
so they get no work do
-PRON- ' like a jerry you do not have to pay
damn son
that be one compelling argument
keep it up filo
we may destroy this government one day after all
these pamphlet be fascinating
it say here that some man gain sympathy weight when their partner get pregnant
if that happen to me -PRON- would be miserable
but happy
but sad
i would have never imagine the baby make process to be this clinical
i mean imagine if actual sex be like this
let me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our gene
and -PRON- ' also weird because we date and we remember what -PRON- ' like to engage in some of those physical activity
exactly
and we be also pretty good at those physical activity
yes we be
yes we be
you know be this all the pamphlet
'cause i think that maybe i have some leave in my bedroom
oh well then we should definitely go look for those

well this be good than meatloaf
when jerry first apply for this job one of this goal be to have a building name after him

the town of eagleton will be dissolve and re absorb into pawnee
pawnee will provide some government service as well as take on some of eagleton 's debt
i understand
look i hate eagletonians as much as you do
i hate their stupid beautiful face and their stupid shiny hair
we look at every alternative
this be the only scenario that prevent eagleton 's financial crisis from spiral throughout the entire region
eagleton be terrible
why should i bail them out with the hard earn money from my unemployment check

because they be our neighbor and -PRON- have sprain their ankle
and when your neighbor sprain his ankle you help him off the court
i understand you have concern and question and we be here to listen to them
i get something to say
one at a time please
i hate the one at a time system
why should we bail them out

stop stonewall and tell us what happen here
i just tell you what happen

when this sick depraved tweet first come to light you say the account be probably hack by some bored teenager
now -PRON- 're say -PRON- ' an unfortunate mistake
why do you keep flip flopping
well because i learn new information
when i be four i think that chocolate milk come from brown cow and then i flip flop when i find out that there be something call chocolate syrup
i do not think -PRON- be out of line when i say that this scandal make benghazi look like whitewater
-PRON- ' utterly meaningless
i think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet
perhaps he or she-- or them
it could be a bunch of hot lady
yes perhaps them can finally give us the answer we need
what what what
there she be
nadia i do not know what you want so i get you a cappuccino a latte four bag of coffee bean and a mini espresso machine

okay
i mean look it do not matter how much money you leave your kid
what matter be that you teach them the right value
but if something horrible happen and you want your kid to be leave alone with no safety net just so they can learn some kind of weird lesson then by all mean leave your fortune to the wild boar who gore you to death

these overall be really starchy
yeah maybe that ' 'cause i turn up the heat to 90 and uh oh the knob break off in my hand
oops
well speak of heat we should discuss america 's white hot passion for voting right and the man and woman who help protect them like the local city councilwoman who be starve and think about her husband 's reservoir dog- themed birthday cake and want to eat it really badly
oh this be not a good sign
once she start think about birthday cake -PRON- ' basically useless until she eat birthday cake
democracy be not unlike a cake

fluoride 's boring guy

-PRON- ' not a chemical
-PRON- ' an aquatic base social medium oral experience
everyone who tweet at t dazzle in the next hour will be enter to win an exciting plain blue t shirt
i say t you say dazzle
t. dazzle
t. dazzle
t. dazzle
thank you for the woodworking lesson ron
this whole crib recall thing have get me literally rethink everything i think i know about parenting
what sleep method will you be using-- ferber sears
swanson method where you close your eye and fall asleep
i really wish ron would engage but he exude so much wisdom that i can learn parenting tip simply by be in his presence
someone like ron be teach even when -PRON- 're not teach
do that make sense
my anxiety have keep me up for over 50 hour
our polling show that 72% of citizen be in favor of add t dazzle to their water effectively kill councilman jamm 's so call clean water bill
eat it jamm
i win
apology accept
you know -PRON- have actually come around to your way of think on this
my only thought be why stop here
lady and gentleman sweetums president jessica wicks
whoo
look we all love t dazzle
but we can do more to improve our drinking supply
sweetums be excited to propose an alternative to boring municipal water
we call it drink ems
whoo
sweetums be prepared to take over the management of pawnee 's water
this be gon na save this town beaucoup buck
take a sip of this delicious water and imagine it come out of your faucet at home
this water be fill with sugar
there ' absolutely no way we be do this
checkmate
do you bring those with you just to do that
maybe
damn
it be a baller move
what be we gon na do now leslie
hey
okay be you still mad at me about the poodle thing
it be just a dumb game
i can pick another dog
-PRON- be not mad about the choice
-PRON- be mad about your reason
pretty
makeup"-- be that all you know about me
we do not hang out that much
-PRON- ' not like you know a ton about me
-PRON- 're beautiful yet cold and aloof
you pride yourself on be a loner
you do not obey you choose to cooperate
and when you stop bar your fang to pick a mate -PRON- ' for life
and -PRON- 're fiercely loyal to your pack which make you a rare black siberian husky
that be so spot on it be scary
i need to go lie down for 45 minute
no an hour a full hour
good morning
this wo not take long
simply put it would be madness to let sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar
what ' next-- cookie dough toothpaste
bad example
that would be amazing
my point be sweetums be an evil profit hungry corporation that be ruin our health
ever since sweetums open its door obesity be up 100%
-PRON- ' unacceptable
down with that poison peddle corporate monster
down with sweetums
hey
hey
hear about your speech
sound great
i wish you could have see it
it feel so good
i love loose cannon 
you know i love the power of no consequence
well unfortunately there have be one consequence
i just get fire from sweetums
because you be embezzle i hope
hey jessica do you do something to your hair
because sister you look good enough to eat
num num num num num
what do you want leslie
you can not punish ben for something i do
-PRON- ' not fair
i love him and i will do anything to help him get his job back
what do you want
i want you to formally apologize for what you say about sweetums
i want you to say that -PRON- 're a moral upstanding corporation that -PRON- 're proud to have in pawnee
and when you make your apology i want you to wear a lime green pantsuit because it will look horrible on you
you be such an autumn
do you need me for something
yes i want to figure out your spirit dog and -PRON- be go to do that by learn everything there be to know about you
all right

favorite movie

excellent
thank you very much for your time
i will have your answer shortly
no idea
if a joint be properly fashion all you need to do be guide it into place
all you need to do be guide it into place
what i get from that be when parenting sometimes a subtle hand be more effective than a strong one
this be already so much more helpful than the last book on parenting i read-- rad dad by apolo anton ohno and shaun white
nah
ron why do you throw that wood away
-PRON- ' unstable
-PRON- ' no good
i just do not understand the throw away the wood metaphor
what ' the lesson
oh i know
-PRON- ' potty training
that trash can be the toilet and the wood be the feces
chris -PRON- be not teach you anything
-PRON- 're just build a crib
no i know -PRON- 're not consciously teach me anything
-PRON- be try to siphon off some of your calm center wisdom through metaphor
metaphor
i hate metaphor
that ' why my favorite book be moby dick-- no froufrou symbolism just a good simple tale about a man who hat an animal
that ' enough for today i think
an organized child be a-- no
okay -PRON- have be work on this for three hour and i know your spirit dog
you be a nova scotia toller because -PRON- 're outgoing and adventurous
and you love canada
no that ' not right
no it be n't
but i appreciate the effort
-PRON- 're good
and do not beat yourself up
-PRON- will probably never guess what kind of dog i be
-PRON- 're right
-PRON- will never guess what kind of dog you be because -PRON- 're not a dog
-PRON- 're a cat
-PRON- 're temperamental
-PRON- 're unpredictable complex and hard to read
you make people work before you let them in
but if they put the time in and prove that they care then you open yourself up to them
right
no no no no no no no
hmm
so let 's all raise a glass full of delicious sugary drinking water to sweetums-- a pawnee institution
leslie do not do this
i have to ben
we can not both be out of a job
what will we do-- sleep all day take cook class together sit on a couch and watch movie
god that sound horrible

there ' more at stake here
i mean you apologize -PRON- will be an endorsement for the drink ems plan
i know that
but-- and everything you say about sweetums be right on
i mean 90% of the charity work i do be to compensate for mess they cause
and i do not want to work for them anymore
be you sure
yeah just go up there stick to your gun
-PRON- ' not gon na make a difference
i can not beat them
all i have on my side be fact and science and people hate fact and science
wait
i have an idea
go get tom
run
get tom
yesterday i say some pretty harsh thing about sweetums and their great new product
but when i look at the research i find some pretty compelling fact about drink ems that make me change my tune
each drink em be pack with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement
mpp be an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 ph buffer
now i know what -PRON- 're thinking-- what about its molar mass
how do 136.086 grab you
what the-- i do not know about y' all but drink em seem pretty boring to me not like h-2-flow
excuse me
i have several binder with very important datum that i need to get through
well miss i think -PRON- would all appreciate it if you just swallow a teaspoon of hush
think of h-2-flow as an app for your tooth
the more flow you take in the more sparkle point you get
get enough sparkle point and -PRON- 're on your way to your first aqua badge collect enough aqua badge and -PRON- will welcome you to the h-2-flow platinum club
-PRON- be great at business and -PRON- be great at park stuff
-PRON- be like picasso meet michael jordan
i can paint but uh i can also be a world class gambler
ron what ' this
the crib i build
-PRON- be give it to you and ann
-PRON- ' perfectly safe
i test it by hit it with my truck
well ron i can not accept
this be for your baby
there ' more than one crib tree in a forest
that ' not a lesson by the way just a comment on lumber availability
-PRON- ' beautiful
thank you
nobody have all the right answer in parenting include me
and that toxic crib you buy wo not be the last mistake you make
but a man who ' this worried about make all the right choice care very much
that ' all that matter
-PRON- will be a great father
thank you ron for the crib and the advice
-PRON- ' much good than any metaphor
do the white whale actually symbolize the unknowability and meaninglessness of human existence
no
-PRON- ' just a bleep fish
hey good news
drink em be dead
as of tomorrow every pawnee resident will have h-2-flow in their drinking water
that ' great news
h-2-flow be fluoride right
i think so
-PRON- will double check with tom but i 'm like 95% sure
wow

this place be so random

-PRON- ' easily the most thoroughly research and passionate grant request -PRON- have ever see
wow you have no idea how meaningful it be to hear you say that
but -PRON- 're a little late
the river cleanup 's well underway
this be big than the river cleanup
-PRON- 're open a new office in chicago
i spend the last few week read about you and your career and i think that -PRON- 're the perfect person to run it
leslie would you like to run a branch of the national park service
tom 's bistro will have all the classic element but with modern twists-- an oak bar live music and sunday brunch with scramble egg so fluffy -PRON- will be like little pillow for your bacon
bacon pillow
i like the sound of that
but i have to say restaurant be incredibly risky
most of them be dead on arrival
-PRON- 're well aware of that but believe me tom have think this out
see there ' plenty of real estate available in the old eagleton part of town
and with the recent closure there ' massive demand for affordable dining that feel high end
okay
as long as -PRON- 're run -PRON- be in
amazing
hey kid your bos here sure know his stuff
ron
what be you do here
the most important government work -PRON- have ever done-- sand rat urine stain out of this floor
what be you do here
i come here to think sometimes
by myself
but now that -PRON- 're here
damn it
i be go to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that i have and you can not ask me any question or detail about it
that be my ideal conversation aside from no conversation
but that feel unlikely
look you know how much i love pawnee
but the more i try to fix it the more people fight me
they call me name they recall me they try to kill the merger
they literally punch me in the face
and yet every time i contemplate leave just walk away once and for all i just can not do it
what be wrong with me
yesterday i fix that old steam radiator
thread a new valve into the side remove the handle from the base unscrew the packing nut from the stem
this subpar toolbox only have one wrench so i be lucky it be a three quarter or -PRON- would have be screw
yeah man you be lucky
come on ron
what the hell
i need your help
by the time i be do this 100-year old piece of american make cast iron be sing like a bird
nowto most people this story would seem boring
that ' ridiculous
-PRON- ' a story about a radiator
but to me it be immensely satisfying because i enjoy fix radiator
you like fix this town leslie you always have
you know -PRON- ' an uphill battle but you love the struggle
i would also add that -PRON- have already do a hell of a lot to make this town better and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work

-PRON- ' quite a looker
thank you ron

really happy that work out for you tom but you kinda sell me out back there
i know and -PRON- be sorry
but mitch ask me what i be passionate about and honestly -PRON- be never gon na be passionate about dry cleaning chemical
to each his own i guess
i know open a restaurant be risky but i can make this work
i know i can
then count me in as the second investor in tom 's bistro
thanks man
i know this be a symbolic gesture but my investor floor be $ 1,000
so as of now you own zero share
cool
thanks for clear that up
now go do work or i will fire you
-PRON- be not kid

okay my fortieth and eighteenth from last question be about the heartland exotic plant management project
now be would i be actually do the physical planting
because it be always be a dream of mine to plant spot jewelweed along the red river bank in arkansas but -PRON- be sure you hear that a lot
well you would not actually be plant thing
i mean -PRON- 're oversee the everyday minutia you would delegate to staff
leslie your job be more creative big picture stuff
no more boring people work for you

i hate paperwork
i hardly ever do it in my bed on a saturday night while listen to old spice girl cd

so -PRON- 're just about ready to go live with the slogan poll
you want to see
now that eagleton and pawnee have merge it be time to pick a new town slogan
and a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town 's identity
there be new york the city that never sleep
and then there be glenwater florida home of america 's most violent walmart parking lot
okay so people can vote now
yeah see that ' the super cool thing about this website be it do all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy
no
no -PRON- 're not gon na do that
-PRON- 're gon na sit forward and take it hard
um what
there ' a lot of nitty gritty left to do ben
we need to roll up our sleeve we need to go door to door we need to hand out flier and canvas
you know what we should do
we should have a press junket to publicize the poll
okay i hope you have lunch plan 'cause now you get to cancel them
well i i do
so this be one of eagleton 's top sushi restaurant
but you can not out run the whale meat police forever
this be great

that ' where the politician will sit this be where the connected guy will bring their goomahs
this place be perfect
how much
9,000 a month
what
that ' way more that i can afford
whatever
-PRON- ' not that great
plus -PRON- ' really far away from work and that 'd be annoying
-PRON- ' not a big deal
i mean when it first launch -PRON- will go back and forth but hopefully it take off and -PRON- will become a full time job
come on -PRON- will show some place in your price range
this press junket be a brilliant idea be not it
mr. strange cameraman

yeah
yeah
i vote for that one
great
-PRON- be wonder be there a way i can communicate with everybody who vote
yeah i can do that
should take about two minute
just paypal me some bitcoins when you get a chance
what
so this be way under your budget
use to be a donut shop
well a tire shop that sell donut
pretty rough
i mean i guess i could fix the roof and tear up the counter
do something about the smell
this place be creepy
i mean i love it because it remind me of the cafeteria in a haunt nursing home but that ' just me
this be the last listing i have that be not an active crime scene
hey man what happen
i think jurassic fork be super popular
we stretch ourselves too thin by expand to a second location
you open another dinosaur theme restaurant
no another steven spielberg themed restaurant
the german place downtown-- schindler 's lunch
i think you may have misunderstand what people like about jurassic fork
i actually think the space be pretty cool
obviously -PRON- would have to move this t rex but-- no can do
that ' a load bear t rex
this be really the last place you have available
dang
maybe tom 's bistro be not mean to be
you want to see me
yeah real quick
remember when you say you would close up shop on the slogan thing
yes
you do do that right
you do not somehow get the email address for every person who vote for the stick up the butt slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email tell them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan
be you crazy
what a crazy talk you just do with your funny word
well someone write those email
and we get about 300 complaint and as a cherry on top some hacker get really mad about the invasion of privacy and attack the website
look what they do to peebo
-PRON- ' wear a hat make of penis
oh boy
well i.t. be fix the website but it will be down for about three day
well no worry i will handle all of the overflow work personally
park ticket code violations-- send them all to me
what ' go on
i do not know
i speak to grant about the national park job and he mention that ' mostly big picture planning and delegating and not very much nitty gritty hand on stuff that i love to do
i would miss that very much
i mean have i really pull my last bloat raccoon carcass from a public fountain
but that ' the whole point of move up the ladder you get to think big swim in a big pond
-PRON- 're have a public forum on the slogan right
use it as a test
hand the rein to someone else let them handle thing while you manage from a distance
yeah
that ' a good idea
i guess i should practice delegate
ugh
okay
the public forum will be run by
oh no i would not have start the sentence if i know larry be the only one here
babe if you can step back and let larry take control you can survive anything
all right
larry can you get in here
i would love to
gosh darn it
i
i somehow run my belt through a slat in this chair so -PRON- be kind of i'm kind of stuck to it now
great
you really should not have dig that out of the dumpster
i have to
also i have a banana on the way over here
sorry
i get why you do not want any more to know about duke silver and you do not have to worry
you secret be safe with me
to even it out -PRON- be gon na tell you all of my secret
oh no that ' not necessary
i once forget to brush my tooth for five week
i do not actually sell my last car
i just forget where i park it
i do not know who al gore be
and at this point -PRON- be too afraid to ask
when they say 2% milk i do not know what the other 98% be
when i be a baby my head be so big scientist do experiment on me
i once throw beer at a swan and then it attack my niece rebecca
that will do andrew
you do not have to play the unity concert
but do not quit music
please
tommy

why be not you have fun
because this prom remind me that you have like a million friend in high school and everyone think you be awesome and i spend four year make fun of everyone and hide mop so the janitor would think he be go insane
if we go to high school together we would have never start date which mean that we would have never get married and i do not like think about that

but that ' because kid in high school be idiot
the only thing that matter be that we find each other right now and -PRON- ' the good

we get that limo for three more hour
i think the extra length could help us get us over that lake

i observe your behavior and if -PRON- ' a five or below i say nothing

-PRON- be look for anything to strengthen my case that the newport land should become a park and not a corporate campus
religious reason animal conservation historical significance
anything
so hold onto your straw everybody because mama ' go grasp

we need a celebrity as a minority owner
it will strengthen gryzzl 's bid
be a celebrity necessary
i prefer quality over flash

celebrity can help with this kind of thing
the nets would not be in brooklyn if it be not for jay z. and the sale for chick fil a go through the roof once elton john buy them
exactly
gryzzl be an outsider here in pawnee
so a local celebrity be go to make everyone feel more at ease with us
and that ' why we call on you home court chiller to frack your brainiums
since -PRON- 're local they want us to think of idea i get it from context
okay
i have no interest in consort with celebrity
the only celebrity i recognize be furniture maker garry knox bennett designer of the notorious and magnus the 5x5 bull elk i see near my cabin two year ago
take a shot at the bastard and he stick his antler through the door of my meat she d

hi leslie
bill haggerty from the pawnee historical society

i hear you be look for information on the newport land and i have some very exciting news for you
it concern william henry harrison
we claim william henry harrison as a hero because he be the first governor of the indiana territory and then president of the united states
-PRON- 're also a little ashamed of him because he do not wear a coat at his inauguration catch a bad cold and die 32 day later
-PRON- ' an embarrassing footnote
but -PRON- ' our embarrassing footnote
-PRON- have recently self publish a biography about harrison entitle barely a president
william henry harrison 's thirty two day in the white house
i discover that harrison have a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land -PRON- 're try to acquire
um spoiler much
now -PRON- will never read that book
if a us president have a house on that land it could qualify for historic landmark status and we could really stick it to ron 's team
which would be ice on the cake not the reason why -PRON- 're do this
okay
show me this incredible lodge
let 's go
that book sound so boring i cry a little
oh babe -PRON- be sorry you have to hear that
-PRON- 're safe now

terry what ' leslie up to
she be try to find a historical reason to earmark the land for preservation
terry come on man

you know i love william henry harrison as much if not slightly more than the next guy but this be garbage
i mean literally
there ' a bag of old hamburger over there

william henry harrison be totally ridiculous

during the election campaign of 1840 william henry harrison supporter roll this 10-foot tin and paper ball down country lane all across america
and they would sing along with a jug band and it be just so exciting
people would come from mile just to see it
why
be there something inside the stupid ball
ooh

this be what we have to work with okay
we be up against a very flashy internet company and we should be aim for quantity over quality
so -PRON- 're go to throw a bunch of harrison fact at them and a big pile of brick and whatever else we can find
quantity people
quantity
wow
this be exactly what i imagine heaven look like

and i think you do know that datum mining be not chill because you sneak it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement
a person should not have to have an advanced law degree to avoid be take advantage of by a multi billion dollar company
you should be upfront about what -PRON- 're do and allow people the ability to opt out
to be honest judge perd be stump by this case

a more accurate name for this place
medical waste butt sweat grove
hi sorry -PRON- be late
-PRON- have have this list for seven year and no one 's ever ask to see it
i think this be a prank call
this place have everything
vermin bullet hole a hornet 's nest
look i appreciate everything that you guy have do for me but even if i put in the time and the money to refurbish this trash heap -PRON- ' not gon na change the fact that no respectable people live in this part of town anymore
damn straight
everything would have to magically change
the whole neighborhood would have to suddenly become safe and clean and have business and people who dine out
no then -PRON- would have to move again
be you think
-PRON- ' possible
but how would we pr
pr
which you could then
yes
right
okay good
guys we have about five day to do three month worth of work but if we pull it off we can rescue jj 's diner we can establish a new national park and we can save pawnee forever
who ' in
i be
oh my god
where 'd you come from
the floor hole
hey
how be your trip
great obviously
bedazzle that elbow
how be everything here
uneventful
so i be think about the idea of go to donna 's wedding
wait before you say anything
i do not think you should go to donna 's wedding to supervise catering
oh
i want you to come with me as my date
oh
the thing be you work for me
so -PRON- ' probably kind of uncool for me to even ask
which be why i sign these document transfer day to day operation of tom 's bistro over to craig
-PRON- will be your bos now
not me
-PRON- ' about time
-PRON- 're lose the cranberry salad effective immediately
you do not have to do this
yeah i do
-PRON- 're great at your job and i want you work here forever and if you do not have feeling for me
i need you to know that everything be gon na be fine
in fact forget it
i be not even serious
-PRON- have be hoax
-PRON- have be tommy ed
just hold on
i be gon na say that i would not wanna go with you as friend
i wanna go with you as your date
oh
cool
craig never mind
you can rip these paper up
well i wish my reign have last longer but -PRON- be happy with the decision i make and the people i fire
oh god
-PRON- would better get back there
you guy i do not know what this be about but -PRON- ' 4:13 so you get seven minute
well we just want to introduce you to the new home of the gryzzl campus
be you trip
we just spend $ 125 million to build our new campus in the southern indiana foothills
and -PRON- will be spend another $ 100 million at least to construct the building road plumbing electrical
whereas here at beachview terrace you can take over five entire square block of historic pawnee
here ' a complete proposal for gryzzl 's new regional corporate headquarters
be this paper
super throwback
my company inspect all the building
they be disgusting i grant you but the gut be solid
-PRON- have lay out construction cost retail space option
you could build a much big campus in this neighborhood and basically break even
plus the good part all the building come pre graffitied
that ' true
we would not have to hire banksy
okay but we spend hella skrilla on this trill forest
so what be we suppose to do with that
here ' a far out idea that just come to the top of my brainium
why do not you donate that land to the national park service
that would be pretty dope
and you could get some baller tax break that could help you with that mad stank construction cost
i do not know
-PRON- be sorry i ca n't
i can not say these word
okay
but why could not we just build the campus here and then keep the land or sell it
you could
but donate it will give you some good pr
which you desperately need
i mean look we be glad that you pick pawnee but if -PRON- 're gon na set up shop here you need to make a covenant with the city
show people that -PRON- 're invest in this town
start by clean up one part of pawnee and preserve the other
okay well i get ta talk to my board as well as our chief legal counsel and our senior advisory team
and truthfully -PRON- 're all shrooming super hard at coachella right now

well -PRON- would have about six people report to her
if she start soon she could project manage our new warehouse in snerling
get to be my own bos
so far so good
she also want passionate interest in subject matter
so what kind of building be it
-PRON- ' a large scale storage unit for surplus vinyl sheeting
okay so that ' boring
would she have an opportunity to practice any creative problem solve
creativity be for people with glass who like to lie
although i suppose she could use creative way to organize and stack the vinyl sheeting
no that ' insane
we use the towson method
-PRON- ' try and true
i think this may be a dead end
i think you may be right
but get a good person out of government be a worthwhile endeavor
i will help
but first -PRON- be go to need some grub
ooh
yeah
let 's grab some lunch and some ice cream and then maybe some after ice cream taco
-PRON- will just brainstorm
maybe grab some snack
vaughn

i do not think that be possible
stephen be careful

we take people that do not know what they wanna do and then put them to work do cool stuff all over the world
and i start in a couple month

but you be out of local government and that ' a step in the right direction
-PRON- ' definitely the job i want
but it mean that we have to move to washington

if you intend to move i suppose you should return the spare key to my house
the one i give you year ago when you be my assistant for emergency

so you know lose a battle win the war
that kind of thing
-PRON- ' the way to go
look
the pie mary be retrogressive and misogynistic and if you participate we will have no choice but to protest you and ben at the event
hope you like pie
in your face metaphorically
-PRON- will be civil
elise

what should we do
should we get a divorce
well how about this
what if i register for the contest
i bake the pie
i act as my own wife
oh that could work
we sidestep the controversy we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate
and then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head
exactly
but more importantly we change the idea of what a pie be
i feel like that ' not more important but i like the energy that we have so let 's hear it
okay picture this crust on the bottom
filling
crust on top
what be i describe
a pie
no

-PRON- will say you know garry -PRON- would lose your head if it be not screw on tight
and then she make me go for the fresh orange for the morning oj

they must have move it during the remodel
-PRON- ' probably in basement storage
to the basement
tighter

-PRON- 're not do anything
and we definitely do not live down here now
guy where ' the old shoeshine stand from upstairs
we do not know anything about that

we be on a quest and we be not leave until we get an answer
well -PRON- 're on our own quest which be to squeeze this just tight enough to make my eye bulge out a little bit but not so tight that i die
-PRON- have be there
that ' a real tightrope walk
oh
hey
last week this real scary ghost come down here look for it
it have black hair but you could see through his skin
it do not like me but that ' just 'cause i get a soul of a ghostbuster

-PRON- ' actually ms. knope
and actually right now -PRON- ' mr. wyatt
leslie have her own busy life and i happen to be an excellent pie maker so we figure -PRON- would switch it up a bit
now pack your suitcase because -PRON- 're go to a little town call napoli in italy
free ben wyatt
free ben wyatt
free ben wyatt
excuse me free me from what
from the tyranny of woman
we be the male men
we be a man 's right activist group and we be feed up
-PRON- be sorry
what ' happen now
behind every successful woman be a man she have oppress
first leslie knope poach her husband 's campaign by make it all about her
now -PRON- ' force him to bake pie and enter a contest for her
excuse me
-PRON- be not force him to do anything
he love to cook
yeah
he have five personalized apron
oh
so i guess he be ask for it because of the way he be dress
we be sick and tired of this feminized society
man have have a very rough go of it for just recently
and it end now
male and proud
male and proud
male and proud
leslie knope exemplify the feminist attack on our value
she could learn a little something about traditional family structure from me and my husband marshall
um
fierce alert
eat 'em up honey
the idea that feminism be an attack on family value be absurd
ooh
so -PRON- 're defend leslie knope
no
absolutely not
frankly i do not think -PRON- ' do enough to distance herself from this misogynistic lunacy
let 's turn now to sasha dunkirk
she be head of the group women against feminism
what a surprise
the woman be only talk to other woman
can we have one conversation about feminism where man get to be in charge
i actually agree with him
i do not need your pity
joan leslie knope and i be united

leslie if -PRON- 're watch i brandi maxxxx star of 69 jump street and fifty shaved old gays have your back
oof

why be not the other candidate 's wife be scrutinize like this
because june hartwell be a lukewarm bowl of nothing
she start an awareness campaign call bring a sweater

how can you tell
oh -PRON- ' a common misconception that the oculus hold all of the power
-PRON- ' actually the lamplighter
ann
oh my god
-PRON- ' happen
-PRON- ' totally happen
our kid be fall in love
this be good
okay remember
if this be ever go to work we have to pretend to disapprove
yeah
right
good call
hey
leslie no
oh
who care
ann arbor michigan be literally the great city that i have ever live in
but pawnee be good
so -PRON- 're move back
that ' great
yeah
-PRON- be go to run admission at indiana
-PRON- be trade wolverines for hoosiers
well -PRON- 're get the good end of that deal
tom
i take the quiz in your book about what kind of person i be
-PRON- be a ron
ha
-PRON- be usually a tom but sometimes -PRON- be a donna
last time i take it i be a tom
what
no
no no no
take it again
-PRON- have get to go recalibrate the quiz
so do anyone have any insight on our running for governor situation
-PRON- have be so busy catch up with everyone
i haven't have a chance to ask them
yeah me neither
okay here ' what i think
i hate when -PRON- 're on opposite side
it stink
plus if one of us run it do not mean -PRON- 're go to win
right
and -PRON- ' not like this be the only career option for either of us
so all that matter be that we be good
right
which be why i have an idea
i think we should flip a coin
i mean it
let 's literally flip a coin
because whoever run be go to do a great job
and whoever do not run be go to be right alongside the other one offer advice and support and whatever they need
so it do not matter
so let 's flip a coin
okay
you leslie knope the queen of planning and binder and pro and con list
you want to leave this to chance
yes
because whatever ' next you and i be in it together
so let 's go tell everybody
and they can participate and they can sign the coin and then you know the coin will eventually make its way into the smithsonian
okay everybody gather around
first of all i just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your child here -PRON- ' like -PRON- ' the great thing that ' ever happen in the history of america
and secondly ben and i have an announcement
leslie be run for governor of indiana
what
bully for you knope
that ' amazing
yeah she get approach by the dnc and they think she have a great shot to win
indiana native supremely qualified
and she write that she want to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal
this make sense
so -PRON- be run for governor
ben be go to be run my campaign because -PRON- ' a super genius and -PRON- ' get a tight compact little body like an italian sport car
but right now -PRON- would like to make a toast
when we work here together we fight scratch and claw to make people 's life a tiny bit better
that ' what public service be all about
small incremental change every day
teddy roosevelt once say far and away the good prize that life have to offer be a chance to work hard at work worth do
and i would add that what make work worth do be get to do it with people that you love
i start my career more than 30 year ago in the parks and recreation department right here in pawnee indiana
-PRON- have have a lot of different job include two term as your governor
and soon a new unknown challenge await me
which to me even now be thrilling because i love the work
not to say that public service be not sexy
because it definitely be
but that ' not why we do it
we do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth do alongside a team of people who we love
so i thank those people who have walk with me and i thank you for this honor
now go find your team and get to work
in addition to governor knope 's honorary doctorate from the school of public policy in recognition of all she have do for the people of indiana the campus library will henceforth bear her name
a library
yeah that should do it
the swing be fix
well there you have it sir
another problem solve by the hard work of dedicated public servant
okay great
bye
yeah that ' about right
okay
well hang on
gayle make me promise to get a quick picture just for old time sake
good idea
garry have a good idea
ugh
the lighting be all wrong
-PRON- be go to send you a glamor shot
just photoshop me in later
