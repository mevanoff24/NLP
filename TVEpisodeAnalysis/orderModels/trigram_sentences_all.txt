the city of pawnee be incorporate in 1817 when a young man by the name of reverend luther howell come from terre haute on an ox
he plant his flag in the ground and be meet soon after by an angry tribe of wamapoke indians who when see the whiteness of his skin twist him to death
flash forward to 1969
man walk on the moon
pawnee be lousy with hippie my_god
-PRON- ' filibuster her own meeting
filibuster
boom
they can not touch you if you talk forever
i can not speak of the future but i will
the future of pawnee will involve us fly around in space taxi where we will communicate on watch and blink our feeling to each_other rather than use word
and now -PRON- would like to take a magical journey through a little something i like to call the phantom tollbooth by norton juster
excuse_me

hear that
he call me park lady
you know normally i do not agree with leslie about anything but this book be awesome

leslie
the parks_department have so_many program
jerry 's in_charge_of our pre teen nature hike

-PRON- have invite a reporter to come do an_article about the pit behind your house
she write for the pawnee_journal which be kind_of like our town 's washington post

it be a classic strategy
the press be a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to fee people
you know the beginning of project be very vulnerable and you have to make_sure that you get a_lot_of press 'cause the momentum of that can kind_of keep it alive or_else -PRON- will die
i mean -PRON- be sure you remember the tucker park graffiti removal project
the tucker park graffiti removal project be a great_idea that just run out of steam

oh -PRON-_'re serious
when you perform a marriage for gay penguin use taxpayer money on government property you be symbolically take a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda
oh -PRON- be sorry but hold_on a second there marcia
that be not my intention at all

leslie be you married

soon probably
i have a plan but no not now
not date anyone yet
focus_on my career
i think so

i do not know that both of the penguin be male and i be just try to perform a cute fun ceremony to promote our local zoo
i have to say that that stunt that you do with the penguin be clearly over the line
now marcia what if anything can miss_knope do to make it right
joan we do not want to be unreasonable
of_course not
we think that she should separate the penguin annul the marriage reimburse the taxpayer for the cost of the wedding of_course and then resign
oh
be that it
that would do it
anything_else
you want me to jump off a building
perform hara kiri
move to a different town

-PRON- would ask you to reconsider

-PRON-_'re just animal

and -PRON- ' very controversial
-PRON- have have someone throw acid at it tomato sauce

we really need good security here
we also need good less offensive history
so the city_council have decide that the spirit of pawnee should be change to something just a little less horrifying

just give_me $_20 worth of art
just something that seem personal that only i could have do
tell_me about yourself
no
just paint
i have no interest in art
let_me clarify
i have no interest in non nude image
dude what the hell kind_of art be this
it look like a lizard puke up skittles
-PRON- be an abstract expressionist
no -PRON-_'re a con artist
and -PRON- be a guy that ' out 20 buck
ugh
whatever
-PRON- be a terrible artist
but the parks_department have do so_much for me that if i can help them out in any way i will
oh_god
maybe i should just give them all free flu shot
i know everything about this town and these mural
and that ' why this be a dream come true
literally
i have have a dream where i design a mural
but then it turn_into a nightmare because the mural start talk and it come alive and it be whisper
and i could not hear what it be say so i lean in close and then it eat me
at one point gina gershon be there
my piece be truly go to capture the spirit of pawnee
i never understand the term elbow grease
i guess -PRON- ' not really grease
just hard_work
oh hey ron nice shiny shoe you get there
oh
hey
i be just
i think
oh no
shoot
actually it look like i scuff this one
do you need your money back ron
because i already spend it
really
how do never_mind
i think -PRON- will just take another full polish
can i cut in line again
i feel right at home as a shoe shiner
i have no idea what -PRON- be do but i know -PRON- be do it really really well
okay
let_'s get go with the spirit of pawnee
ann you go first
okay
um okay
well since -PRON- ' the parks_department i think i would design a pretty park
with dog play
and i can not really draw so i just cut some stuff out of a magazine
that look like something a death row convict would make in art therapy
dude i try
and you fail
-PRON- ' dog and people play in a park
-PRON- ' cute
-PRON- ' okay sweetheart
you can not make art because you be art
-PRON-_'re beautiful
but that suck
okay
let_'s see yours
fine
mine be amazing
-PRON- ' go to blow your mind
okay
this be some professional as art right here
-PRON- be not quite_sure what -PRON- be look_at
-PRON- ' abstract leslie
over here -PRON- have get some shape
and then you come over to this side you know
-PRON- ' actually kind_of interesting
each shape be its own thing
but then when it come together it really give you a sense of completion
hmm
a piece_of art cause me to have an emotional reaction
be that normal
so -PRON- ' the last supper but with famous people from indiana
mmm_hmm
john mellencamp larry bird michael jackson uh david letterman vivica a. fox
okay so here ' where it get a little dicey
because there ' not that many celebrity from indiana
so a nascar
uh my friend becky ron_swanson
donna
who ' the jesus
that would be greg kinnear
i do not know he be from indiana
yeah you know i read that he be
oh
do you think -PRON- ' the good choice for jesus
i mean he be great on er
greg kinnear be not in er
yeah he be
i do not think that he be
who be i think of
okay
next
wow
really good jerry
for my murinal i be inspire by the death of my grandma
you say murinal
she
no i do_n't
yes you do
you say murinal
i hear it
anyway she jerry
why do not you put that murinal in the man 's room so people can murinate all over it
jerry
go to the doctor
you may have a murinary tract infection
i just want to show you my art
murinal
murinal
murinal
disqualified
-PRON- ' pointillism
and each dot be a photo of a citizen of the town
no one care
at all
okay
so this be a multimedia project
first a_bunch_of rat make out of garbage
and this be a tv screen
-PRON- will be like a big flat screen tv and it will play looped video of knee surgery
and then this be a human sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one
and it will be spin and there will be like a fat guy in it all the time like scream and like eat raw beef and like bleeding
and like blood will like come out of his_mouth and stuff
and that will be like right next to the mural
i have one question
why
if you have to ask you do not get it
i do not think they really get the assignment
if -PRON-_'re gon_na beat all the other department we have to choose something that will stand the test of time
like the mona_lisa
or the music of squeeze
june 8 1922
the pawnee bread factory burn to the ground
we lose a_lot_of good bread that day
as well as several human life
and it also make the whole town smell_like toast
which one resident describe as disturbingly enticing
but i digress
the point be we rebuilt pawnee to the wonderful town that it be today
why would you want a mural that show people die when you could have shape that come alive
well because -PRON- ' the most famous event in our town 's history
and people love vote for tragedy
look_at the oscars
this be our holocaust movie
this be our english patient
it sound_like -PRON-_'re exploit the tragedy
see ann get it
okay
time to vote everybody
cast your vote
may the good most tragic project win
when we start this we be six different voice with six idea for a mural
and then those six voice come together as a team
there be no loser today
but there be one winner us
the parks_department
tom the result of the vote please
one to one to one- to one to one to one
we all vote for ourselves do not we
yeah
okay
third time today
mmm
that ' a good shoeshine
what the man
i
i do not know what happen
frankly
i emit a noise
the noise be involuntary
sometimes a sound be just a sound
you know
we need to whittle these down
can we all agree on eliminate any of these design
ann 's blow
wow
do not hold back
no_offense but -PRON- ' a giant picture_of a park
that ' not art
well at_least -PRON- ' not a fat human hamster eat meat
you do not even work here
okay guy you both have a point
ann yours be a little trite
and april yours be hellish and may make someone vomit

-PRON- be not gon_na stab you in the back or anything so maybe i should go somewhere
maybe i should move to eagleton

leslie you do not have to move to eagleton
when i become city_manager my job be yours
of_course my first act as_city_manager will be to propose eliminate the parks_department
although i expect a spirited debate with leslie
who know what the future hold for me
maybe -PRON- will leapfrog ron 's job and become city_manager
of_course my first act as_city_manager would be to double the size of the parks_department
although i do expect a fight from ron
but -PRON- will win
mmm

-PRON- ' a little flowery
shut_up

a yes
b even if they do_n't -PRON- will just put the concert on ourselves

let_'s make it an even 40
that ' not necessary
slash it
slash it
i be an_official member_of a task_force dedicated to slash the city budget
just say that give_me a semi
right off the bat we sell city_hall
let somebody turn it into a large ga_station or a t.j. maxx
ron that be a very creative idea
but we do not want to sell any of our major asset because we do not want to lose out on any future revenue stream
i hear that
do_not_worry
i have ton more idea
okay
uh so sorry
new ring tone
do not cut anything without me
leslie
i do not care if you hate what we do

-PRON- ' not that i want a massage
-PRON- will be the caboose
and ron_swanson be the locomotive
and thanks to ron the service budget have already be cut significantly
so seem_like the good option be job cut
start with leslie_knope
no no no no no
if you fire leslie you may as well just get_rid_of the department
look i know how valuable she be believe me
but -PRON- have run out of option
there be plenty_of other option
for_example sell the zoo animal
okay
to whom
cosmetic lab
weird restaurant
-PRON- be just spit ball here
okay let_'s switch it up
look she make the second high salary in the department
it will go a long way

-PRON- ' because whenever i see you talk to ann or talk_about ann i feel_like you still have feeling for her
what
no i do_n't
but i do_n't
really i do_n't
well i think you do
so that ' a problem for me
because of my libertarian belief leslie do 95% of the work
so you should lie me off
-PRON- would be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war
-PRON- ' precisely because of your belief that we need to keep you
you would maintain fiscal responsibility after -PRON-_'re go
i strenuously object
okay

okay
so we know the people who run this government have no faith in us
my plan be go to change that and bring the budget back
and the answer ' be right in_front_of us the whole time
check your testicle
no
not that
although that be very good advice
look_at you jerry
no
what ' go to save us be right there
gentlemen i realize that time be tough and the budget be tight
but if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their house and play_video_game then pawnee will die
and we refuse to let that happen
now
this town be historically know for two thing
widespread obesity and the annual pawnee harvest_festival
people from all over indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizen be
and while they be here they would also attend the festival a full week of corn_maze hay ride ferris wheel pumpkins the size ofjeeps
we lose that festival a few_year ago due to another round of budget cut
and i propose we bring the festival back
with ticket sale and corporate sponsorship -PRON- will earn all that money back
and believe me people will come
what if they do not
well then you eliminate the parks_department
and you guy be all on board with this
aye
yes
look -PRON-_'re not just pencil pusher
we be a reflection of the community
and we believe that we can strengthen that community
because in the end the reason why -PRON-_'re all here be to bring people together
that literally be the most moving thing -PRON- have ever_hear
and a good_idea

a student at king philip middle

be that why you do this
to impress your daughter
liz 's mom and i divorce a couple year_ago and -PRON- ' be really_hard on her

that ' really sweet
you should have tell_me you be do this for your daughter

-PRON- be sorry
this be a mistake

yeah what happen to a perfect encapsulation of life in pawnee
well for that guy life in pawnee be him and his daughter read that book
besides i can get shauna on board

uh if this get out every_time you want to do anything some guy 's gon_na come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe

-PRON- be marcia langman from the society for family stability foundation
this book contain pagan creature and strong sexual overtone
there be girl quiver
there be boy star deeply into girl eye as they quiver and so forth
there really be a tremendous amount_of quivering
it be anti christian it be pro quivering and the government have no business promote it
i totally disagree
well now we have two people for twilight
absolutely not
-PRON- be with the national civil liberties association
that book actually contain overt christian theme and as such have no business be associate with any government project
so too christian and not christian enough
do you see the irony here
no
okay
uh donna why do not you put a question mark next to twilight
no
you promise
you promise
that ' not fair
wait -PRON- ' not a question of fairness
-PRON- ' go back to russia commie
hey you go back to russia
you go back to wherever you come from
why would i go to russia
i have no interest in travel to russia
can i just say that
and who else
i would like to include my_favorite book crazy from the heat the david lee roth story
well i think if -PRON-_'re gon_na be add a book to the time_capsule it would probably be twilight
i do not care_about twilight
why be this only about his favorite book
i want my_favorite book in there
okay i have_an_idea
two time_capsule
one that totally encapsulate what ' happen right_now in pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that ' just for item of personal significance like twilight
no twilight
yes twilight
hey
hey
thanks for come
i only have a second
i have to get to work
bella ' go on her first hunt
i just do not get why you break_up_with me
be it 'cause -PRON- be not cool enough
like the normal kid compare to the vampire
be it an edward bella jacob type situation where you like me but there ' someone_else you like more
uh -PRON- ' nothing to do with twilight
it just do not work out
okay
well what difference do it make
if we stay together you probably would have just dump me for ron
actually that ' the reason
i believe you when you say that -PRON-_'re not in love with wendy anymore but -PRON-_'re definitely not cool with her date ron
you talk_about it constantly
well i can not help it okay
i mean -PRON- ' so manly and -PRON- ' my bos
imagine if your bos be angelina jolie and then one day she just start date your ex_boyfriend
would not that freak you out a_little_bit
well not if i have a great new boyfriend dumbass
look tom i like you
-PRON-_'re really cute and -PRON-_'re funny and -PRON-_'re small enough for me to throw you around
so if you ever work through this then give_me a call
my grandmother live in pawnee for 60 year and i wanna put her ash in the time_capsule

uh_huh
i come across some financial record when i be do some research for my book and this ga_station be own by an m. jagger which at first i think be a woman

i know what -PRON-_'re do leslie
-PRON- be show you a part_of rock and roll history
you you can not do this

what about this
oh_my_god that would be awesome
-PRON- ' impossible

so -PRON- will steal my_dad 's car
look this be a stupid idea but right at this exact second we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it be
you be absolutely right
no thinking just stupid
yes
buddhist feel that human_being be unlikely to be reincarnate as human_being
so the problem with reincarnation be that you could be reborn as a pretzel
or a socket wrench
ron if you could be reincarnate what would you like to be
socket wrench sound pretty good actually
what religion be i
well -PRON- be a practice none_of your bleep business
i think the danger in believe in reincarnation be that you spend so_much time try to figure_out what -PRON-_'re go to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one -PRON-_'re in now
ann_perkins that be beautiful

would you like to make a statement at this time
yes
i freely admit to the relationship and i will not be fight the charge that we violate chris rule
but we do nothing else wrong or unethical
in 1849 sarah nelson quindle expose her elbow outdoors which be a class a felony

-PRON- be not go_anywhere and we be gon_na debate soon and i need to warn you i know my stuff
so you should toughen up
why be you guy smile
i feel_bad
hey quick_question
that little girl from your video
oh_my_god -PRON- ' so_cute
do you think you can talk to her and let her do an ad for me
that girl be me as a ten_year old
how_'d you do that
maybe you should see one of the other doctor
no
no more doctor
-PRON-_'re a_bunch_of scam artist
they reel you in with the free stuff
next thing you know bam you run into an_ambulance
every_time
let_'s just go_home and care for each_other
we could buy a sewing kit
you could sew up my lip underneath a bridge somewhere
mmm so romantic
oh sorry i forget
let_'s_go
all_right
do you think sewing kit be cover by insurance
or grocery or like xbox game
what be insurance
i do not know
who_care
i will institute a reduction in tax for the small business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business relate development
together we will build a good pawnee
so what -PRON-_'re look for here be your overall impression of this candidate
what do you like about her
what do not you like about her
her idea her voice her clothes probably
well my campaign have a little momentum so -PRON-_'re try to capitalize on that by do a focus group
some thing be very helpful
other thing be not so helpful
all the thing make me feel a_lot_of feeling about myself
-PRON- ' kinda short do not you think
aggressively short almost
-PRON- ' like -PRON- ' throw it in my face
insightful
you sir say you would not vote for her correct
yeah
yeah she seem a little uptight
she do not seem_like the kind_of person you could go bowling with you know
what
that ' ridiculous
i be excellent at bowling
ask ron
leslie i know -PRON- ' tough to hear these thing but just try not to get obsess over one comment
-PRON-_'re totally right
-PRON- be not obsess
okay what be you do
-PRON- be just remind myself to tell ron to tell you how good i be at bowling
all_right
i actually think that she be smart and -PRON- would vote for her
there you go
although i once know a leslie and uh she be just awful
so now i hate all leslies
would she consider change her name
okay here we go
a strong command of the issue
that be good but only 33% say that they would consider voting for you
mm yeah that ' really interesting stuff
why do that guy say that he would not want to go bowling with me
you really have to let that go
-PRON- have never be very good at let thing go
i can not tell you how_many time a fun tug of war with a dog over a chew toy turn contentious
one of us always end_up mad
i do some research too about the guy who say the thing about me and bowling and his_name be derek
oh_my_god
and get this -PRON- ' not even that good of a bowler
his average be 132 accord to the most recent available datum
leslie that comment be not really about whether -PRON-_'re good at bowling which i be
ask ron
which we all know you be
but some people have the impression that -PRON-_'re a little elitist or intellectual or_something
that be so sexist
-PRON- ' just because -PRON- be a woman
would they deign to say such thing to woodrow wilson or benjamin disraeli okay i see what -PRON-_'re talk_about
see a_lot_of people do not vote with their brain
they vote with their gut
i know -PRON-_'re fun and you can have a good time
the public need to see that
well then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night
hmm
it would be lay back
everyone have fun great photo_op
that could actually work
also -PRON- be really good at bowling
no i do not think i believe you
be there anyone i can ask
yeah
ask ron
oh okay
-PRON-_'re kid

-PRON-_'re right but use basic logic and human intelligence one can surmise that this be a link to an image
this be not what we want print on the sign

there you go
that ' highly against protocol

oh campaign

excuse_me
if the bread and breakfast
this be leslie
this be the final word with perd with your host perderick l. hapley
issue number_one be the first issue -PRON-_'re go to talk_about
be bobby_newport_'s campaign for city_council in trouble
when i say your name i want you to respond
dylan
well newport 's poll number have be plummet
they just fire his campaign_manager and where ' bobby
-PRON- ' on vacation in spain
-PRON- ' not on vacation -PRON- ' in hiding
every_time the guy speak he put his foot in his_mouth
that ' a hilarious image
a foot in a mouth
-PRON- ' a common expression
okay
accord to the new poll leslie_knope be now in second place
-PRON- ' just 15 point back
whoa yeah
how do she close the gap
you have to give a_lot_of credit to her campaign_manager ben_wyatt
so apparently newport just fire his campaign_manager because ben be kick his as
ben be the good campaign_manager anyone could ever have
every move -PRON- ' make have work
-PRON- ' like a brilliant sexy little hummingbird
what do you just say
nothing
keep up the good work
-PRON-_'re do great
senior citizen be basically the only people who vote in local election so if you want to win you get_ta get the gray vote
and to get the gray vote you need to get the endorsement of ned_jones
-PRON- ' the president of pawnee seniors united
-PRON- ' like the godfather but old
-PRON- ' like the grandfather
the grand godfather
the grond father -PRON- ' like--
it do not matter
-PRON- ' important and -PRON- ' old
mr. jones such a pleasure to meet you
please do not get up
do_not_worry
i ca_n't
oh
just joke
i can get up
but -PRON- ' difficult
but i can do it but it be hard
look i do not have a_lot_of time
oh_god
-PRON- be so sorry
be it cancer
no i do not have a_lot_of time before my swim aerobics
oh
why be you better for senior than bobby_newport
three word ramp up pawnee
pawnee be way behind the time in term of make its building wheelchair accessible
not enough ramp be the number_three complaint among pawnee senior right behind everything hurt and i 'm die
you want to see me
good god
what the hell be you do
upside down sit ups
great exercise and it literally let_me see the world from a different perspective
be not there a man 's gymnasium where you could do that
the world 's my gymnasium ron
but i will stop if it make you uncomfortable
could you hold me while i dismount
thanks so_much
you bet
question for you
in a town of this size the parks_department traditionally have ten employee
you have only seven
why be that
i work_hard to make_sure my department be as small and ineffective as_possible
the department be so small because leslie_knope single handedly do the work of four people
and -PRON- ' already scale back her time
if she win -PRON- will be divide her time between parks and city_council
-PRON- be go to have to hire a deputy_director to pick_up the slack
no
chris that ' unnecessary
the department be do fine without leslie
then prove it
complete one major project
either we complete a government project which be abhorrent to me or we bring a new person into the department which repulse me to my core
remind_me_of when my_dad make me choose which of my pet calf to slaughter with my own hand for my sixth birthday
i could not choose so i slaughter both of them
and they be delicious
essentially -PRON-_'re go to put a ramp on every building in town
like i always say stair be a young man 's game
damn straight
this be very impressive
you know you remind_me_of my brother
you have the same name leslie
he lose a third of his body in a motorcycle accident
the middle third
but they suture the hell out of him
he's-- -PRON- ' fine now
much short but a good look young flat man
what have you hear about newport 's new campaign_manager jennifer barkley
uh who
she want to have a meeting with me at 5:00
i tell her sorry
i do not talk politics after dinner
oh_my_god newport hire a real washington hotshot
wow
she work with james carville
she run two republican congressional_campaign and a senate race
yeah
and check out this picture
-PRON- ' eat egg salad with colin powell
that ' the most impressive thing -PRON- have ever_see
why be you smile
why be this terrifying information make you smile
newport 's scared
i mean he must have shell out a fortune to hire her
so what do we do next
-PRON- be go to set_up a meeting
i mean we can size her up but_more_importantly -PRON- will humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you
and -PRON- will do it at jj_'s_diner
home field advantage
as a candidate i appreciate your strategic mind but as woman all i care_about be your slight but powerful body
hello ann_perkins

-PRON- ' just do this for the money
she do not even like her own client
this could be the good case_scenario for us
or the real good case_scenario be if she just take the money and do not even try
tell_me a_little_bit about leslie_knope
well perd leslie_knope represent everything that be wrong about politics in america
-PRON- ' naive -PRON- ' untested and -PRON- ' an entrenched bureaucrat that ' get the stink of big government all over her
oh_god
what
wow strong word from a powerful lady
so i guess we both agree
leslie_knope be wrong for pawnee
bad case_scenario
bad case_scenario
-PRON- be leslie_knope and when i grow_up i want to be a unicorn princess or a city_councilor
wrong
not in my town kid
city_council ' a real job for a real adult
-PRON- ' play every hour on every channel
-PRON- ' official
i hate jennifer barkley
when i go to that senior_center -PRON- be go to go up onstage and -PRON- be go to viciously attack her
okay do not let barkley knock us off message
we be go there to get ned_jones endorsement
and that ' huge
-PRON-_'re right
and i should listen to you always because you be a man genius with a taut narrow frame like a sexy elf king
do you wish i be tall or-- what ' go on
nothing
-PRON-_'re perfect
okay everyone
so the health_department be work on a poster campaign to warn people about disease
now we be go to build a good water_fountain for the park

okay
that could work
andy

thank you andy

would you just go dummy

this be the voss water butler by tumi
and only $_600 a bag
april what ' your idea
to go in that room and finish this book

-PRON-_'re go to stay_here and -PRON-_'re go to help
donna

yoo hoo
-PRON- be over here
just about to start my presentation
i-- uh oh stair

how do i get from here to there
-PRON- be not a professional mountain climber
-PRON- ' a real problem in our town but not any_more thanks to ramp
up pawnee
-PRON-_'re go to put ramp in every building in this town because if there ' one thing i believe -PRON- ' that stair be a young man 's game
yeah
ramp be an_idiot 's game
this be nothing more_than a bad version_of bobby_newport_'s plan
what plan
bobby_newport do not have a plan
be somebody just talk_about bobby_newport_'s plan
because ned_jones and i would love to share it with you
come_on out here ned
ned_jones be here
say hello to ned_jones
make way for ned_jones
why do not we just turn up the pressure
that way you do not have to put your_mouth so close
all_right here we go
ah stop
honey -PRON- be sorry
that will teach you to pay_attention
i have_an_idea
um i be think what if we do something like this
oh my-- dude what the hell
bobby_newport_'s plan be call rise up
pawnee
he be go to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town
wow
now you could use a ramp but that seem_like a_lot_of work
bobby_newport think that the stair should do the work for you do not you agree
give him a hand
as president of seniors united i endorse bobby_newport
-PRON- have start meet with people to fill in for leslie
i have find five candidate -PRON- would like to hire and two -PRON- would like to be lifelong friend with
well you will not be hire anyone because my department be just finish up a major project
incoming
get you
donna do_n't
excuse_me
help everything -PRON- be wear be suede
everything -PRON- be wear be suede everything -PRON- be wear be suede
excuse_me everybody
attention
i think -PRON- will agree that this department could use a little leadership
kamikaze
oh stumble for the first_time in month the knope campaign seem to be roll down a ramp to nowhere
we be get our butt kick by a guy who be not even in the country
-PRON- ' make out with some floozy in majorca
sorry i wish i be good at this
then you could be make out with some floozy in majorca
maybe we take the fight to her
i mean i could try to get you on perd 's show and you could tell_him how she steal your idea
that sound good
okay -PRON- will just do that
i can call or maybe -PRON- will just go down there
hey
chris want you in his office for the final round of interview
and sorry we goof around so_much
normally -PRON- would be very_proud_of you for what you do
this be a rare example where waste a full day of work be a bad thing
be there really go to be a weird new person in the office
i think so
we may be in for a good_old_fashioned shake up
jennifer barkley
you two faced carpetbagging-- hi leslie
good to see you
hi nice to see you too
you be a two faced carpet-- you want anything
anything
-PRON- ' on me
everything in this town be so cheap
i would never accept anything from a two faced carpetbagging-- leslie
please
let_me get my insult out
-PRON- have be practice it the whole way over here
i sense that -PRON-_'re angry
tell_me why
because you steal my idea and yours wo_not even work
ramp be more practical and -PRON-_'re less expensive than lift
my idea be good
oh i do not doubt it
the fact be i do not care
ramp lift your plan my plan-- i do not actually care_about any of this
-PRON- be just try to win
look -PRON- ' not personal
i like you
but my job be to beat you
so have a seat
-PRON- will get you some of those waffle you love
how do you know that--
-PRON- ' my job to know
god -PRON-_'re good
i know
hi guy
what ' so imporant
well after yesterday 's hand on brainstorming session-- water balloon fight
fair_enough
we think we come up with a fountain idea that really work
present the amazing spoutless fountain
huh
what
we just remove the splash guard because if -PRON- ' not there you can not put your_mouth on it
well i'll-- -PRON- will try it
i do it
good job babe
simple elegant and cost effective
if your team keep this up i think we can hold off on fill the leslie void
i think ben ' already fill the leslie void
oh
oh
-PRON- will give it up for that
so what ' ben 's next move for you
oh oh -PRON- be not go to tell you that
oh let_me guess
um -PRON-_'re go to attack me
-PRON-_'re go to go on that perm show again so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea be yours
-PRON- ' perd first of all and no
maybe
no
that ' not a terrible idea
no actually it be kind_of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that i steal your idea which you do
which i do everyone ' go to think -PRON-_'re a sore loser a goody goody nerd
because you know what people do not care_about
they do not care_about whose idea be first
they care_about whose idea be good
well let_'s say that that be our plan which it be n't
mm_hmm
okay
what would you do instead
oh leslie
i really should not give you campaign advice
right ah what the hell
if you love chess which i do but you do not have anybody to play against which i do_n't then sometimes you just get_ta play yourself
you could attack the newport plan for cost too_much money
no but that would backfire because then we would just say you can never spend too_much on senior of_course
you need to beat our idea
come up with something good
i do not know
maybe a free shuttle service for senior
all_right that could work
wow
waffle and a cappuccino
gracias marta
jj_'s do not have a cappuccino maker
oh it do now
i buy them one
course you do
you talk to barkley without me
i want to tell her what a jerk she be
and then she guess your plan immediately and demolish it
okay as a rule you should not take advice from your opponent 's campaign_manager
but what if -PRON- ' right
well what if -PRON- ' a trick
i mean maybe she think our original plan would work and she convince you to use her plan instead because she know that wo_not work
or maybe she think that we think that she think that so we wo_not do it
but she know that i know that she know that-- -PRON- ' in our head
-PRON- be sorry leslie
-PRON- ' good at this than i be
hey there be no one on_earth that i would_rather go into battle with than you really
yes
so tell_me what do we do my campaign_manager
i do not know
okay
-PRON- would like to talk_about your future
why be we on this bench
this be weird
you do a great_job solve that problem today
the leadership you display have get me thinking-- i do not solve that problem
april do
really
why do she tell_me you do
because -PRON- ' april and she do not want you to think that she actually care_about something
if -PRON-_'re look for someone to help fill in for leslie april ' a pain in the as but -PRON- ' clearly the answer
perhaps -PRON-_'re right
should i go
oh -PRON-_'re still here
yes
let_'s begin the show by start it
now leslie you claim the newport campaign steal one of your idea
well uh they do they steal our idea
we be work on the ramp up pawnee initiative for many week
oh perd
this be politics as_usual
the fact be bobby_newport_'s plan be good for senior good for pawnee
well our plan be more practical and -PRON- ' cheap
there she go again perd
i do not know where she go the first_time
bobby_newport care_about good not cheap for our senior
and our flash poll seem to agree
some 78% of those we survey prefer the newport plan to the knope plan
this be why ned_jones have endorse us
let_'s get back on track
i just think o opppposition be lose sight of what all this be about
what this be about be pawnee and that be what i care_about
what bobby_newport care_about be romp around on some beach in spain with a floozy
excuse_me
oh maybe you have not hear of it
it be not in the new york times or le monde which be what she read
it be in the pawnee paper
bobby_newport_'s personal life be neither here nor there
-PRON- ' certainly not here
and i think pawneeans deserve a city_councilor who stay in the city like i do
well we be go to keep this sececret until we have everything in writing but bobby_newport be try to convince a major european company to open up a factory in pawnee
and that woman that he be with be an antiland mine advocate
i do not realize that you be proland mine
i be not here to declare a winner but jennifer be the winner
thank you
now -PRON- ' time to move onto our next segment which be a commercial
i be go to get drunk and then -PRON- be go to order a three course meal where each course be make of dessert

councilman pillner that can not happen
-PRON- have get to know the city_councilman pretty well because of my campaign

leslie that budget be all but finalize

so the new emergency protocol for the parks_department can be find in your binder
what exactly be the chain of command vis a vis on site response
you know what why do not we just say that whoever get to the emergency first will be in_charge
okay so if there ' an explosion say in ramset park and someone from sewage get there first -PRON- would be in_charge
i have no idea how terrible leslie 's job be
she refer to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride
-PRON- be not quite_sure but tom can answer that if what be you do

what about a cologne that can kill spider
ron_swanson it be my pleasure to inform you that you be a finalist for the job of assistant_city_manager
chris i feel i should remind you that i do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist
that say -PRON- would be a fool not to pick me
i will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it mean -PRON- be able_to further limit reckless government spending
i mean i have so_many idea
some be simple like take down traffic light and eliminate the post office
the big one will be tough like bring all of this crumble to the ground
there be one more step in the vetting process
you and i will embark on a quick session of heart_rate meditation focus_on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra
-PRON- be not sure -PRON- be interested_in that
no i be sure
i be not interested_in that
ron you and i be very different people and we have often be at odds
it be crucial that you and i spend a day spiritually engage and consider what it would really mean to work together
trust_me -PRON- will love it
-PRON- will see you tomorrow
oh wear your yoga pant
okay i really wish we would've talk_about this first
what could possibly be wrong about me save the parks_department budget
i do not know
that ' the point
-PRON-_'re think like a parks_department employee not a city_council_candidate
-PRON-_'re in a campaign literally
everything you do right_now be politics
oh really
be this politics
ow
what be what be that
what why do you do that -PRON- be in a good mood
because the city_councilor listen to me
it mean i have some juice
look this may be a good thing
but there ' a reason we strategize before we make decision
okay
okay
-PRON- will make some call see where we be
enjoy the view
what be go on
-PRON- be just really into you
gimme a spin baby
i hate do leslie 's job
-PRON- be fill in for a person_who smile 90% of the time
tom can you please help me
please
or just do it
come_on lil sparkle
do not give up
what do leslie always say
i do not know weird stuff about waffle
she say you get out of a job what you put into it
you just need to find a project -PRON-_'re passionate_about
for instance i be incredible at name drink at the snakehole_lounge because i care a great deal about signature beverage
the beer yonce knowles
-PRON- ' just a regular beer but we put it in a sexy as mug
pair nicely with the jay zima
we buy a_bunch_of zima when the factory shut_down
that sound_fun
maybe i should work at a bar
come_on there must be some aspect_of this job you care_about
hello
here be some paper leslie request
these be blank
weird
as_long_as -PRON- be here can i ask you a question
do you ever participate in meditation with chris
oh yeah
when we date he make me do it every week
what be i in for here
okay here ' the deal
-PRON- ' crazy boring it last forever -PRON-_'re gon_na wish you be dead
do you wanna borrow my yoga pant
hey
so do pillner finalize the budget
be we okay
we be the opposite of okay
what do you mean
to keep the money in parks -PRON-_'re gon_na shut_down the westside animal shelter
the money have to come from somewhere and the shelter be on its last leg
so -PRON-_'re close it at the end of the week
that ' where champion come from
what will happen to all the other animal
well -PRON- will be fine
no
-PRON- will be no
guy
apparently leslie_knope wield her insider influence and get councilman pillner to save her precious department even_though it mean close the shelter
now i be not say that leslie_knope be a dog murderer per se i just think that her action raise some question
like for_example be she a dog murderer
god
well i do not know the answer to that jennifer but your tone make me think yes
say your good_bye pebble 'cause weswie knope gon_na kill you
she get the perfect puppy for that shot
she be good
leslie there be a woman on the phone that say her daughter 's scared to go to sleep because leslie_knope ' go to come murder her kitty
okay we can fix this
yes we can
tomorrow_morning we be go back to pillner and tell_him to cut the parks_budget
no no no no
we can figure something_else out
leslie
hey honey good_morning
how do you sleep

-PRON- be gon_na make pancake
be that a pig

yes that be a pig
this be the good meditation center in the area
it do not look like much
actually this strip mall have surprisingly decent chi
although the smell from the greek restaurant next door be not ideal
but through this door lie a deep serene quietude
excuse_me lady
on your right
after you ron
now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit
now quietly sit behind me and let_'s join breath
-PRON- will stand

do not want none_of that animal dander interact with this cashmere
what ' your endgame here my dear
this be only temporary until i find a way to keep the shelter open without cut the parks_budget
hey what if i throw together a pet adoption in one of our park would that be cool
april that would be the cool thing since n sync aerosmith and nelly perform together at the super_bowl halftime show
ew
i think i may have find a project -PRON- would actually enjoy do help these cat and dog
they should be reward for not be people

i get nothing out of that experience at all
so if -PRON-_'re look for someone_who enjoy meditation

with due_respect leslie i be retire at the end of this term so -PRON- have be fine with you guy push me around on this budget thing
but if -PRON-_'re ever gon_na hold this job there ' something you need to understand
city_council be not about make everybody in town happy
in fact every decision you make be gon_na make a_lot_of people very unhappy
we play with live ammo around here

-PRON- be okay
-PRON- be just-- -PRON- be nervous man
-PRON- be nervous
gah
i guess i want to do a good job because um i like it when people think i do a good job
and i want your vote because i want pawnee and my_dad to see what -PRON- be make of
so let_'s do this
the wreck crew
who let you guy in
hey jason
ease back
this question about public safety come from twitter because apparently that ' something that happen now @munchmeat2015
ask pawnee use 2 b safe
some1 steal my car
what will u do 2 make pawnee safe can u help me find my car
i can assure you if you have a gun mount on the dashboard which automatically shoot people try to break into it you would still have your car
you know i guess i would like to tell mr. munchmeat that i think that stink that happen to him
you know one time a guy steal some downhill ski out of my jeep
and i be so mad i punch a mailbox
-PRON- be against crime and -PRON- be not ashamed to admit it
i can not get through to the cable company
can you do something
like what
anything
andy 's just act out scene from his favorite_movie
so swayze run boom
tackle the guy off the motorcycle
dude 's like you 're dead bro
come at him
swayze duck scissor kick
sha
the guy have swayze 's head
and he say i use to bleep guy like you in prison
by the look of this guy this be not consensual sex -PRON-_'re talk_about
we see bad guy have a gun the whole time
-PRON- ' like -PRON- 'm a kill you the old_fashioned way
swayze 's like not this time
that ' subtext
he do not say that
bypass the gun hook the arm
back to the secret move he use before to kill somebody he feel so bad about it
but this time he have to do it because -PRON- ' self defense
k k k kah
take the esophagus out of the neck area
you can not eat
-PRON- will starve to death
and that be road house
what should i do next
leslie_knope
this question be about pawnee 's park system
why be ramsett_park so filthy and awful
-PRON- ' difficult to get into the complicated problem with ramsett_park in such a short amount_of time
you have 20 second
oh_my_god okay
i will say that the park in pawnee-- i do have an update on your time allotment and that update be that your time be almost go
i have no more time leave
well you have some time when i start talk but by the time i finish your time be up
thank you very_much
-PRON- ' off her game
-PRON- ' fine
mr._newport rebuttal
i know this
if something be dirty we should clean it up
let_'s start there
right
you know what i have this clean lady name yolanda who be very wise
she basically raise me
and one day she say little bobby -PRON- be not go to clean your room no ma
and from that day on my room be gross
really bum me out
i think we should make our park look like my room after yolanda finally you know give in and clean it up for me
if i may joan
that ' a very_sweet story bobby but not all of us have yolandas who can clean_up our room for us
some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeve and do the hard_work yourself
-PRON- would just like to say that like leslie i do not have people do my work for me
leslie and i do our work ourselves
my work of_course be have sex_with man and woman on camera
once_again brandi and leslie be essentially the same person
but bobby_newport be super handsome and charming so that mean people will probably vote for him because there ' no justice in the world
how do you respond to newport 's claim that the city park need to be clean_up
leslie_knope work tirelessly every_day so our park can be the good they can be
our park pristine
and we all know the better look a park be the more attention it will get from lady park who want to have sex_with it
excuse_us
what the hell be wrong_with you
-PRON-_'re fight for our life out there
oh i do not know
maybe the fact that we just break_up and -PRON-_'re already rid the traeger train
what be you talk_about
i see you guy get back together
what about us
what about us tom
-PRON-_'re not together any_more because you keep act_like an as
-PRON- be sorry
i just act that way sometimes because -PRON- be nervous and i feel_like -PRON-_'re out of my league
but -PRON- would do anything to get back together with you
please
vote for me to be your boyfriend
ben -PRON- ' win
how be he win
everything -PRON- ' say be nonsense and -PRON- ' fool them
okay -PRON-_'re do fine
i need to go back on the attack
no
no no no no no
see okay
when you attack you kind_of come off like a bully and he look sympathetic so you know y you do a really good job of ease off
leslie this be fun be not it
yeah
well there ' no reason on_earth that i can think of that we should not have concussion grenade in our nation 's movie theater
by the year 2013 we will have a fully functional mall on jupiter
sure i agree that movie should be more faithful to the book that they be base_on but what do that have to do with this election
all my movie be base_on book
and anyone who even rub their hand on a leather jacket should be try for murder
-PRON- be an american
my father be an american
my_mother be an american
my godfather be the viceroy of the principality of liechtenstein
once_again people grenade launcher
daniel craig
no timothy dalton
i be in favor of close the border bookstore not the border to mexico
i guess my thought on abortion be you know let_'s just all have a good time
i do not care_about that issue
just ask someone_else
for the record -PRON- would appear in a film with any of my fellow candidate
anteaters
kill shoot
money shot
fudgsicles
let_'s spend our money on what matter
police fire park and school
after a rough start your girl 's do okay
um i think -PRON- ' do a little good_than okay
or do you miss the applause she get on the raccoon safety question
oh that be great
that probably pull her even with bobby
i can not believe -PRON-_'re so casual about this
do not you even want to win the debate
oh -PRON-_'re gon_na win the debate
get an ace in the hole
little surprisey wisey
what
oh -PRON- will see
hey quick_question
do that guy chris_traeger have a girlfriend and be his penis normal
stop talk
you guy uh know anything about a guy name john rambo
open on villager be throw out into a rice field
land_mine blow them up into piece
after i steal this cable feed i will repay the cable company for the service we use
this last question before the break be for mr._newport
uh some not me have criticize your involvement with your father 's candy company sweetums
would your affiliation with big business affect your decision as a city_councilor
i want to run this town like a business
my opponent leslie_knope have a very anti business agenda
recently my_dad tell_me that if leslie_knope win the election -PRON- will probably have to move sweetums to mexico
that would be terrible of_course
thousand of people in this town would lose their job and we all would not have candy
now -PRON- be not say that be gon_na happen but i do know this
if i win i bet i could get them to stay
wow
shock stuff
-PRON-_'re gon_na be back with our closing statement right after a word from our sponsor sweetums pawnee 's big supplier of candy and job
stick_around
so sweetums be gon_na move to mexico if bobby do not win
how could they do that to this town
what a crappy stunt to pull
one minute back
what do we do
i think we attack him
-PRON- ' more confident now
i have to attack him
and say what
we do not plan for this
what would you even say
i do not know
-PRON- will figure_out as -PRON- be say it
just let_me attack him
i want to attack him
no no no no
-PRON- ' too risky
just go with the close statement we rehearse
add a line at the end about how -PRON-_'re pro business and -PRON- will deal_with the fallout tomorrow okay
what
what ' the matter with you
i can do it
i can crush him
i promise
ah screw it
go get him
really
kick his as
i be lineman for the county and the wichita lineman
be still the line
the final thing these candidate will say be their closing statement
we will begin with our first candidate to go bobby_newport
how do we fix this town
i have no idea
you tell_me
that ' what -PRON- be count on
you tell_me

-PRON- ' on
and leslie_knope close statement
-PRON- be very angry
-PRON- be angry that bobby_newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you do not give him what he want
-PRON- ' despicable
corporation be not allow to dictate what a city need
that power belong to the people
bobby_newport and his daddy would like you to think it belong to them
i love this town
and when you love something you do not threaten it
you do not punish it
you fight for it
you take_care_of it
you put it first
as your city_councilor i will make_sure that no one take advantage of pawnee
if i seem too passionate -PRON- ' because i care
if i come_on strong -PRON- ' because i feel strongly

when you be able_to focus your mind and your body anything be possible
anything be possible
ms. pinewood recently many of the local restaurant have change their small size option to a whopping 64-ounce
that ' correct and -PRON- ' great for the consumer
more bang for the buck
be we put bargain on trial here
how could any sane person call that small
well if the customer truly want a small size there be an option
oh do you mean the li'i swallow
do anybody buy that
some girl buy them for their dollhouse but -PRON-_'re not very popular
i mean for only a nickel more you get 64 ounce
well uh paunch_burger just recently come out with a new 128-ounce option
most people call it a gallon but they call it the regular
then there be a horrifying that the call child size
how be this a child size soda
well -PRON- ' roughly the size of a two year_old child if the child be liquefy
-PRON- ' a real bargain at $ 1.59
-PRON- be sorry ms. pinewood but why would anybody need this much soda
-PRON- ' not my place to speak for the consumer but everyone should buy it

and in the same bed
god i miss that man
how can you be so wise and so inappropriate at the same_time
-PRON- be a parent
i can not figure_out_how to phrase this mission statement

it be a good quilt
it be an awesome quilt
look my_parent be insane but they need to be at our wedding
you know what
-PRON- ' time for this team to come up with a new plan
i agree
phase one of our new plan you get in the backseat of this cab and we hardcore make out for 15_minute

-PRON- be just not sure if the driver would be okay with it
for another 100_buck you can do whatever you want
let_'s do this

if you do want to be take seriously you may want to think a_little_bit about how you present yourself
no this be publicity for orin 's new performance art show
-PRON- ' an animal live on a human farm
and you can go and fee him from your own hand
ugh that ' horrifying and so be orin

-PRON- have be try to put a park there for four_year
see the thing be april that lot be mine
-PRON- have be do slow painstaking work

yes
so you want to be my cfo
well i already have a job but -PRON- will help as a friend
as_long_as you take what i say seriously
i do not want another entertainment_720 disaster on our hand
yeah it be a disaster
too_bad we do not see it come
all_right what ' my first move
you know i think any of the four previous location would work but there ' something about this place
it just have a really good energy here you know
lot_of natural light
-PRON- ' tiny and awful and loud
and -PRON- ' zone 14b industrial waste clean_up site
we should technically be wear hazmat suit right_now
it seem_like the kind_of place a ska band would go to shoot heroin
come_on guy this be a great place for a dog_park
i mean look there ' already a dog here
oh_my_god
i have that exact doll when i be a kid
this is-- this be traumatic for me

which guy
ricky jordache
never hear of him
what ' his deal
-PRON- ' new
he use to be a slacker but now -PRON- ' realize his full potential but at what cost
-PRON- ' smart and -PRON- ' beautiful and i think of him in many way as a daughter but that would be crazy 'cause -PRON- ' a man and his_name ' ricky
here ' my question
how do you use to slow me down when i be become too me ish
sometimes -PRON- would just give you busy work
i once have you put together a brochure about different kind_of indiana topsoil
that soil brochure be not busy work
i mean people still refer to mulch ado
about nothing
and if you be particularly amped up about a project -PRON- would take you to jj_'s and distract you with waffle
those be distraction waffle
i think they be friendship waffle
breakfast_food can serve many purpose
but what if this person this ricky who be real do not like waffle or anything
everybody have something -PRON-_'re passionate_about
just figure_out what it be express an interest in it and divert his attention
howdy neighbor
welcome to human farm
here ' your animal feed
please do not fee the animal
wow this be really really cool

yeah
i see that now
hi orin
ms. wicks if -PRON- have read our proposal -PRON- will see that an alliance between rent a swag and sweetums could be mutually beneficial

it mean that the only reason you bring me here be to distract me from the dog_park
you hate this show
i love this show
what ' your_favorite part

he think -PRON- ' a great_idea
-PRON- ' gon_na support my motion at the city_council meeting tomorrow and he give_me a really cool dental mirror to check out my molar
our dispute aside you should be careful with jamm
-PRON- ' a snake -PRON- be tell you

lady please let_'s keep this civil
councilman pawneeans satisfied customer of jamm orthodontics as we discuss what type of park to put on lot_48 i have a thought
how about no park
who here think park be stupid

i happen to know for a fact that pawnee 's favorite fast_food restaurant paunch_burger need a new location
now see as how the future of lot_48 be open for debate i move we sell it to paunch_burger for a nice profit
you do not even have to be asian to do math that simple

-PRON-_'re just gon_na fill out this stupid report and that ' it
as a future cop you have to understand i can not let this guy go
look man
this be what most police work be
just write stuff down
-PRON- ' not superhero time
if it sound boring maybe you ought to do something_else
maybe we should find the person_who steal his positive attitude
hey man
hey man
get any_more job offer since i last see you
yeah but it be just a management position at urban outfitters
i turn it down
i do not know man
maybe i can not hack this
maybe i should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job
well my accounting job be not bore
if it be remotely interesting there would be a show on a&e about it
they have a show about storage unit auction

-PRON- be not be melodramatic when i say that people from eagleton be snobby and evil and they look down on pawnee and they would most likely exterminate everyone who be not from eagleton if they be not so busy be obsess with themselves
god that be close
sometimes when i rant about eagleton i forget to breathe and i pass out
no
we can not have someone from eagleton design a park for pawnee
we have have a blood feud that have last for 200 year
well we do not have a_lot_of time and he be the first decent candidate
so let_'s at_least go meet the guy
yeah that ' a good_idea
then we can reject him face to face
i like your plan

ben
leslie

thank you so_much for come

well what do you think of our new park
eh
in a word underwhelming
and a little inconvenient
there ' no trash can anywhere
what be i suppose_to do with my garbage just throw it on the ground
oh hey
thank you for the trash
mr. st._james i have to say this park be incredible
thank you
its official name be five mile grounds but we like to call it wide smile abound
because of all the smile that occur
-PRON- ' so boring
come_on -PRON- will take you guy on a little tour
great
he seem super cool
he seem cool
just you wait
well they always wine and dine you first but the fact of the matter be eagletonians be without exception snobby condescend jerk
this be the pawnee side of our border with eagleton
and this be the eagleton side
ah
uhh
hey babe -PRON- ' me

-PRON- be so bored
i need you
if i come down there can i at_least break something

i do everything i be suppose_to do and i walk around the building four time
only 20_minute have go by
ugh
think maybe ten_minute have go by since i start talk
-PRON- ' only be 15 second
ohh
oh babe thank_god -PRON-_'re here
i get so bored
i start think about existence-- do i matter

just dumb stuff like that
ugh
who_care
i think be a security_guard would be exciting
nope
wait a minute

-PRON- ' quiet
a little too quiet
as you can see we like to keep thing quite immaculate
i remember when pawnee have that massive sewage overflow in circle park-- whatever happen with that
we totally fix it
well except_for the smell
the scientist think -PRON- ' go to linger for another 40 year
can we just cut to the chase here
why would a fancy eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny pawnee park
well i hear your plea on the radio and you be so passionate_about the project
it do not matter if -PRON- ' a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park
-PRON- ' about the people
-PRON-_'re here to serve them
hey mr. st._james
oh our balloon artisan be out of balloon
excuse_me

-PRON-_'re like a southern belle when rhett butler come around

rhett butler
that ' who he remind_me_of
or bono
what
no one from eagleton have ever want to help anyone from pawnee for any reason
in 1988 we be hit by a tornado

but i have to warn you -PRON- be very good at ice skating
i can do jump
you know what
i probably should not come
-PRON- will embarrass the both of you
actually i know what my next activity be gon_na be
and -PRON- ' a biggie
i want to be a mom
-PRON- be go to the sperm bank today
can you come
wow today
ann you know that i fully support any woman 's decision-- especially a beautiful unicorn nurse like yourself-- in create the family that she want
but you be so brilliant and kind and stupid hot
i mean -PRON-_'re definitely gon_na find a wonderful guy who love you and respect you and fill your home with multi ethnic genius baby
maybe or maybe not
you hit the lottery with ben and that ' great but not everybody ' so lucky
-PRON- have want to be a mom for a long_time -PRON- be ready and i think -PRON- would be good at it
ann be give up on love and decide to have a baby with herself
and she have only be date herself for six week
if she be date a guy for six week and they decide to have a kid -PRON- would be like
congratulation ann and channing tatum
because that be the only scenario that would make_sense to me
what a gorgeous herbaceous medley
there ' be a mistake
-PRON- have accidentally give_me the food that my food eat
salad be traditionally the first course at a wedding
be a gerbil marry a rabbit
-PRON- be in_charge_of food for the wedding
so i bring in pawnee 's three good caterer and a panel of expert
chris love vegetable
ron love meat
and tom consider himself a foodie which apparently mean take instagrams of food instead_of eat it
okay so i like number_one chris like number_two and ron like number_three
tom what about you
caterer number_one 's presentation be simple mm yet exhaust
number_two 's be subtle and provocative like a coy dutch woman guard a dark secret
nothing -PRON-_'re say be helpful
but number_three 's tell a story-- a story from a book i would not read but i would watch the movie of
that ' nonsense
you know what
-PRON- be gon_na go with the first place
i really love that appetizer
oh the mini calzone
i would not call it that
it be more like a savory pastry
delicate little dough pocket fill_with tomato sauce cheese and seasoned meat
just a stunning culinary innovation
it be a calzone
it be literally just a small calzone
let_me just get some detail for your file
now be you two a couple
no
tragically we be both heterosexual
so ann what be you look for in particular
some sperm
i mean in term of a donor
oh you know nice guy nice sperm
flip through this binder make a note of anyone who interest you and -PRON- will be back shortly
oh
this guy go to harvard
so do the unabomber
this guy seem healthy
love cycling
yeah so do lance armstrong and he turn_out to be a lie drug user
or a hero
i do not know where we stand on him now
hello lady
fancy meet you here
whoa sewage joe
wow
ann you remember joe fantringham
he be the gentleman who be fire for email a picture_of his penis to every woman in city_hall
guilty
yeah that ' what the judge say
mmhmm
joe you be a donor here huh
do you hear that ann
big time me and all my buddy
free money free porn
good job i ever have
also if -PRON-_'re look to buy some weed -PRON- be look as well
shall_we
yup
okay leslie_knope outfit number eight
babe you look super_hot
you realize -PRON- have say that about all of them
well she have every_single time
'cause she be super_hot
honestly -PRON- would look hot naked
ugh
this suit make me want to scold a catholic child
i do not know who ann taylor be but i hate her and i want to kill her
i have to lead a public_forum for the pawnee_commons every_day this week and i hate talk to people
so to get through it i figure -PRON- be just gon_na basically try to imitate leslie
she still wear this
she have the patch sew in
you can not remove it
what ' in the pocket you ask
a ticket stub from a fleetwood mac concert in 1995 and this one be terrible but it be slightly less terrible than the rest
so tomorrow i lead a public_forum in leslie 's fleetwood mac sex pant
fleetwood mac sex pants
new band name
i call it
ooh you know what
maybe just fleetwood mac
so what ' the next move
be there like a good sperm bank in eagleton or_something
um you do not want a demon baby
look -PRON-_'re ann_perkins
sperm that be worthy of your perfect egg do not grow on tree
i think ideally -PRON- would want to know the guy right
-PRON- would want to know his personality his favorite season of friends whether_or_not he hat jazz-- hopefully he do
-PRON- would want to know him
yes leslie -PRON-_'re totally right
-PRON- be gon_na go_home and -PRON- be gon_na make a list of all the guy i already know who could be donor
and then -PRON- be gon_na call them and tell them -PRON- be do some blog entry on man 's health or_something
i can interview them and ask them whatever i want
-PRON-_'re a genius
this be your idea and i love it
-PRON- will call you later
no
if i do not slow this baby train down ann may end_up have a baby with some random weirdo instead_of her soul_mate
i fully believe that a woman should be in_charge_of what happen to her body
in this case the body be ann 's and the woman in_charge_of it be me
i be up all_night brainstorming and this be the complete official list of candidate for ann 's baby daddy
wow how do you come up with these three name
well i eliminate everyone in a relationship and the obvious no s like knuckle hair dave from hr
i do not mind the knuckle hair
i just think -PRON- ' a dick

ann_perkins ask me if i would like to donate sperm so she can have a baby
-PRON- ' a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyze fear of negatively affect any live thing
there ' $ 60 miss from the register
i think mona_lisa 's steal from me
yeah it be absolutely mona_lisa
-PRON- ' a total klepto
and nympho and pyro-- all those thing
okay as your cfo i recommend get_rid_of her immediately

this be jerry_gergich calling
bye
i have to tell you a secret
but if you tell_anyone i will kill you slowly with a giant syringe
good_morning april
what ' your secret
-PRON- be think about apply to veterinary school in bloomington
oh_my_god april that ' great
whoa where_'d you get that
the internet
so i really need a letter of recommendation
and since you work in a hospital as a janitor nurse
i be wonder_if maybe you would write one for me
really
generally between us april always have the upper hand
and that hand be usually give_me the finger or pour honey in my purse
but now i have the upper hand
and -PRON- be go to use it to crush her into be nice to me
i would be happy to write you that letter
i actually know the guy who run the veterinary program over there
because you hook_up_with him
i do not hook_up_with everyone i know
although yes we do hook_up
but before i write you that letter you have to spend the next_week with me and do everything i say
so i have to be your slave or_something
no you have to be my friend
no that be so_much bad
do not do that
i think i have a plan of how to save your store
if we get the pawnee historical society to declare your store as a historical landmark then you may get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat
that sound_like the government meddle in private enterprise
well ron we all know how_much you love the free_market
but the pawnee_videodome be the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual
that and the slam poetry night at beanie 's coffee
but i do not count those because those poem do not rhyme
anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this
-PRON- ' pointless
this man be a failure
he be not up to snuff
his business be fail and -PRON-_'re bail it out
this be a bailout and i do not like it
and there be some pretty intellectual conversation down at barrett 's hardware
you may get a little heat for this okay
so use your money wisely
get popular film that people wanna see
like uh get the tarkovsky movie no
like pixar
reese witherspoon
i know this be gon_na hurt but maybe some michael bay
what
no no
no
tom i have something i need to talk to you about
do we need to sit like this
yes
mona_lisa 's take advantage of you
and -PRON- be sure that -PRON- ' not easy when -PRON- ' the sister of a dear friend
oh no -PRON- ' not that
she scar the crap out of me
i once see her punch a police horse in the face
speak directly to her and tell her i will not be disrespect
-PRON-_'re tom_haverford
-PRON-_'re a smart successful young man with an adorable little belly
stand up for yourself
yeah -PRON- will talk to her before the party
and if she murder me tell jean_ralphio to clear my browser history
thanks for the advice man
-PRON-_'re welcome
son
what ' that
nothing
all_right
pawnee_videodome be where i rent my first bruce lee movie
and my second bruce lee movie
and when i be in seventh grade i go out back in the alley behind the store and there be a giant hornet 's nest
and i throw a rock at it and it explode
and hornet come out
andy-
the point be obviously you do not throw rock at a hornet 's nest
and the point be also that the pawnee_videodome be a place with tremendous community value where people gather to expand their horizon
any_other comment here before we vo-- ron
what be you do at a city_council meeting
be you lose
be you hurt
no i be here to express an opinion
this action by councilwoman_knope be nothing more_than a thinly veil government bailout
and i for one refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape
allow me to elaborate
the government should not prop up a fail business
that would be like give food to a mortally wound animal instead_of slit its throat and properly utilize its meat and pelt
please stop talk_about wound meat
pawnee need a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art
a place where you can rend such film as cinema paradiso or rashomon
you rent rashomon
what be your_favorite part_of that
i haven't rent it actually yet
but i like the idea that there be a place where i could rend rashomon
uh you can just watch it online for free whenever you want
bailiff
thank you mr._swanson for your absurd opinion which be share by no one
now be there any_more public comment before we vote

except_for jerry who be great but who we have to pass on for other reason
i be just happy to be consider
anyhoo i nominate you for the position and your confirmation_hearing be in three minute
surprise

okay
let_'s tear this chick a new one shall_we
ms._ludgate we have find many email show how you sexually harass leslie_knope 's assistant
andy
that ' my_husband
they be still extremely graphic and appreciate by all of us
i have never hear of several of those term and -PRON- be a freak
those be personal
no one 's allow to read those
you once post a video of yourself drink alcohol in city_hall while you be still a minor
how do you justify that
easily
alcohol be delicious and fun damentally a substance that should not be abuse
i agree april
very good point
wow
ms._ludgate be you a ventriloquist
i mean that be amazing how you make your word come out of ms._knope 's mouth
would you like to put her on your knee
i mean that 'd be really fun
just three_year ago you
drove-- -PRON- ' not ready
now -PRON- have rush her into this and now jamm 's sharpen the knife
leslie no one need to be jam today
okay all we need be some kind_of distraction
grab that gavel and break your other foot
i like the idea of double the signing but i think the negative outweigh the positive
do not panic
maybe she can pull this off
i guess my first move as director would be to fill your office house and car with snake and then train a crow to fly up your butt
okay
let_'s take a brief recess
well well well look who ' back
thank you so_much for see us again sir
we just come to apologize
mr. dennis_feinstein let_me just say from the bottom of my heart my bad
i just start work here and i really want to do a good job and i blow it
thank you for say that
thought about it last_night and i decide that if you come in here and apologize to me like a man that i would forgive you and that ' what -PRON- have do so -PRON-_'re forgive
to that end here be a check for $ 25,000 for your charity
oh go out there and help some kid with their pink eye or whatever it be you guy be do
mr. feinstein thank you
this be extremely generous
-PRON- ' nothing really
-PRON- be happy to help
this check be make out to go bleep yourself
in your face dennis_feinstein help no man
get the hell out of my office
hey what ' your problem man
why do you make me apologize to him
guy guy just hold it-- hold_on a sec okay
mr. feinstein with all_due_respect you be a major dick
what
run
eddie get my crossbow
crossbow
what the--
you will pay for this
hey you look good
i guess actual medicine can be effective
who'da thunk
please leave me alone
not until we go over your test result and your blood work
your blood pressure look fine
-PRON- be not sure how this be possible but your cholesterol be 120 which be the low -PRON- have ever_see
what ' cholesterol
and the only problem i see be that your potassium 's low so just eat a banana once in awhile
no thank you
i live the way i live i eat the thing i eat and -PRON- will die the way -PRON- will die
that ' oddly beautiful but also stupid
-PRON-_'re not alone in the world anymore ron
-PRON-_'re date a woman who have two kid so every three day think about ivy and zoe and diane and eat a damn banana
i be so sorry april
you be do terribly up there and -PRON- ' all my fault
-PRON- ' not you -PRON- ' me
be you break_up_with me
-PRON- be break_up_with the idea of you be director of animal_control
i say we just withdraw your application and let vern become director
he do have good tooth
no
all_right i have_an_idea
trust_me
ms._ludgate it be the opinion of this committee that you be terrible
can you give_me even one reason why -PRON-_'re the right man for this job
no
but neither be your guy
neither of us should get the job
oh no
why be that
there should not be a separate animal_control_department
its budget be tiny and -PRON- ' ineffective and frankly no one could change that
so i think it should be absorb into the parks_department
that be a genius idea
somebody wake_up milton
history be be make
iwo jima
animal_control would be way more effective if it run through the parks_department and if you want i can write up an_official report in language simple enough for even you dummy to understand dummy
councilman you have to admit that that idea make a_lot_of sense
hang_on a second
you seem to be forget that i already tell vern he get the job and he already buy a new speedboat
well i hope he keep a receipt
that be a brilliant idea from a dark tortured genius and i move that animal_control be absorb into parks and_rec
i second that
yay
look_at that april
you win over jamm
uh no she do_n't
-PRON- be just sick of be on the losing side
-PRON- be go to tell everyone this be my idea
retro jam
what do we do now
can i apologize again
-PRON- be get really at apologize
screw that
you should apologize for apologize to that guy
god we really could have use the money though
just wish -PRON- would make a big impression
you did--
i be really impressed by all the stuff the foundation 's do for all them poor homies so you know what
rend
a swag be gon_na donate five cent from every dollar we make this month
-PRON- ' not feinstein money but -PRON- will help
that ' very generous tom
feinstein 's the bad
i hope he get into an_accident drive that rolex mobile
for the last_time -PRON- ' a rolexus and you can not drive it
april i have a gift for you
ta_da
at leslie 's suggestion i have make you deputy_director_of animal_control within the parks_department
-PRON- will be amazing at it and the good part there be no confirmation_hearing
how do you make this plaque so quickly
i have it make your first week here
i know -PRON- would be go place so i want to be prepared
can i hire an intern not yet
can i hire a mexican elf
no can i buy a child bride
no
then how be this even a promotion
government should not operate base_on personal favor
it should operate base_on good_idea
april have the good_idea and today the good_idea win
leslie i really have to go to the bathroom
oh yeah right sorry
you do not have to come in with me
i be not go to
could you pick_up the pace a_little_bit
oh yes miss daisy
night ron
night ron
lady lady
ted ted ted
ted
ted
ted article two
section two of the pawnee charter read be it decree should the taxation of tea rise to an unacceptable level citizen shall dump ted into ramsett lake
do anyone object
as always i object
nay enough dithering
dump the miscreant boo
today be ted party day where we commemorate the great pawnee tea dump of 1817
historical fun fact-- when the found fathers write the charter their old timey script make one of the a"s look like a d so tea become ted
-PRON- ' just one of those little thing that remind us of pawnee 's rich and vibrant past
plus we get to go find a guy name ted and throw him in a lake
one
i do not even go by ted
two
i go by theodore
three aah
hey ted
great_job today
you be so funny when you be like my cell_phone i leave it in my pocket
then you check it remember and it do not work
yeah that be hilarious
listen i be just here to say that i be do with ted party day
ha
classic ted -PRON- be serious
-PRON- be not get dump in that lake anymore
and i talk to the other teds in town and -PRON-_'re not do it either
come_on ted party day be protect by article two in the town charter
and we have the right nay the obligation to dump ted into the lake every_year
that ' the way -PRON- ' always be do
okay first of all that ' the way -PRON- ' always be do be not a good reason to keep do something
second it be a misprint
they clearly mean tea
i just think you need to be careful about speculate what the founders mean when they be write the town charter
okay fine
you want to enforce every_single old law we have on our book
hey can i see your key for a second
here ' a quarter
i own your car now
wha-- sorry
the pawnee charter clearly state that any white citizen have the right to seize any indian property for 25 cent
that be an outdated and racist law
and obviously they mean american indian
whoa i think we should be careful when we speculate what the founder intend when they write the charter
okay ted
i know what -PRON-_'re do
-PRON-_'re quote me back to me
but -PRON- be gon_na quote me back to you and say that ted party day will never change
uhoh
you a woman just raise your voice to a landowning male
accord to a pawnee statute pass in 1868 i get to do this
i be not aware of that statute
ron you have to help me
chris be make me do some stupid management training leadership course
now that you run the animal_control_department you have qualify for the chris_traeger management training seminar or ka tumts
-PRON- ' not a great acronym but it be a great seminar
can you get me out of it
yes
normally if give a choice between do something and nothing -PRON- would choose to do nothing
but i will do something if it help someone_else do nothing
-PRON- would work all_night if it mean nothing get do
ron_swanson and april_ludgate literally my two favorite people in the catalogue universe
april will not be participate in your pointless course because she have more_important thing to do like not participate in your pointless course
i just want april to become as great a department head as yourself
which be why this be pointless
-PRON- have be head of the parks_department for 12_year and i never have any management training course
ron -PRON- have never be ka tumtsed
i be legally require to ka tumts every department head
otherwise we be open to all kind_of liability
what be you say
-PRON- be say that tomorrow during the seminar april be go to have a classmate
and spoiler alert-- -PRON- ' alf
-PRON- ' you
this go poorly
what no
damn_it
what be you bid on
it better not be terrence howard 's tank top from hustle flow
it be not
good
'cause i be bid on it and i be ready to spend an amount that my accountant call dangerous and irresponsible
jj_'s_diner put an_old waffle_iron up for auction
-PRON- ' the perfect breakfast_day gift for leslie
breakfast_day
leslie have anniversary for everything
zoo day first_time we go to the zoo together double date day it be the first_time we go on a double date
daniel day lewis day
talk like a pirate day
talk like a pittsburgh pirate day which why and how
this calendar be last_year 's calendar day present celebrate the first_time she ever buy me a calendar
you have to buy a present for every one of these
she always tell_me not to but then she buy me something that ' awesome and thoughtful and then i feel terrible
but that ' the thing
this be the perfect present
i just keep get outbid by someone name tall tie ree on lannister
what kind_of name be tie ree on anyway
-PRON-_'re kid right
tyrion lannister
lord of casterly rock
the half man
you do not watch game of thrones
no you do
hell
yeah
have you see those dothraki dude
they can get it
everybody on that show can get it
i think i know who -PRON- be bid against
i now realize that i be wrong and -PRON- ' time that we purge the book of many of our town 's outdated and obscure law
the bill that i have write with the full support of the city_council will repeal 110 obsolete law such as all menstruate woman shall be confine to their bathtub and article two aka ted party day
the floor be now open for public comment
oh here we go
thank you
my name be garth blundin and i object to your ridiculous proposal
the pawnee charter shall not be change
not today not ever
wow a_lot_of passion mr. blundin
thank you so_much
your objection be note and officially in the record
shall_we proceed to a vote
no
no we shall not
article seven section three allow for a citizen filibuster
if i stand here and refuse to yield my time you be prohibit from vote on the bill
that section define buffalo meat as acceptable currency
be that the buffalo meat one
mm_hmm
i mean article three section seven
let the filibuster begin
i would now like to share some idea i have for j.j. abrams seventh chapter in the star_wars saga
pan down from the twin sun of tatooine
we be now close on the mouth of the sarlacc pit
after a beat the gloved mandalorian armor gauntlet of boba fett grab onto the sand outside of the sarlacc pit and the feared bounty hunter pull himself from the maw of the sand beast
ugh -PRON- ' right
he can do this
this be exactly why we need to modernize these law
this kind_of thing make_sense when we have council in a barn and there be but now this be nuts
if he hold the reality gem that mean he can jump from different reality
this will be our link to the marvel universe from the star_wars universe
imagine those who be up against chewbacca 'cause that ' gon_na happen
after a beat luke say darth vader be my father but ben kenobi be my master
and he cut hannibal lecter in half
mr. blundin look the law -PRON- be try to get_rid_of have no more relevance in modern society and -PRON-_'re embarrass to pawnee
repeal them would show that -PRON-_'re change with the time
you can not just change the charter willy nilly
you start by casually repeal a couple of old law the next thing you know your jack boot storm trooper be kick in my door and arrest my_wife for no reason if i be marry
by jack boot storm trooper do you mean the pawnee police_department
hey clyde
hi leslie
good danish today
the pawnee charter be not a live document ms._knope
you have no respect for the tradition of this town
i absolutely do
i use to give tour at the pawnee historical house
three time employee of the fortnight
oh big_deal you put on a costume for a couple hour
by that logic every_time i go to bed at night i be wolverine
you buy x men pajama
i win them madam in a raffle
the point be be that our found father be brilliant and they be courageous but they also have wooden tooth and pooped in hole in the ground
it be a more primitive time
it be a good time
you would not have survive two_week in their day
oh really
how about a little wager
how about you and i go live in that historical house no modern technology if you last longer i withdraw my bill
i win you stop this nonsense
you have yourself a deal
please write down what you hope to gain from the seminar seal it in the envelope and then -PRON- will open it when -PRON- ' over
when be this over
as_soon_as you learn to embrace the power of positive motivation
-PRON- ' a nine hour seminar over two day
whoa
oh good
all_right let_'s begin
hop on board the management train
first stop-- motivation station
all aboard
stop bid on my waffle_iron
-PRON-_'re futuremrstigerwoods

i do not know how to change it
the point be -PRON- be get that waffle_iron for leslie for breakfast_day

oh okay
i do not even have time to tell you how wrong you be
actually -PRON- ' gon_na bug me if i do_n't
the lannisters while very wealthy do not possess the magical ability of say the warlock of qarth for_example
this be why we do not hang_out
think of yourself as engineer steer a locomotive of positivity that run on team power
first of all you do not steer a locomotive
the track do
second there be only three way to motivate people-- money fear and hunger
oh i disagree
what about encouragement appreciation and smile
when people feel supported they will literally explode with productivity
can you guy just figure_out which way be good and tell_me so we can leave
thank you for your input april but the ka tumts require that we follow a very specific syllabus
-PRON-_'re not be very inclusive chris
i feel_like my input be not be appreciate

oh yeah
he be the mayor at the time
-PRON- have always want to meet him
well today -PRON-_'re get that chance
so be he like a really great mayor no not really
he resign because of corruption and racketeering and then he die from an overdose of pill
but actually his real cause of death be be throw out of a helicopter while handcuffed
some people say -PRON- ' still alive because they never find the body but they never find the body because he explode on impact
sound_like a good dude
yeah
i just wish i have a chance to meet him you know year_ago before all the scandal and his death
but this be nice too

filo pilo
be you kid me
listen now that jerry 's go we need to hire someone to pick_up the slack
a new person in the office

an intern
why on_earth would i get an intern
intern cost nothing to the taxpayer
and more_importantly -PRON-_'re usually stupid and terrible
so they get no work do
-PRON- ' like a jerry you do not have to pay
damn son
that be one compelling argument
keep it up filo
we may destroy this government one day after all
these pamphlet be fascinating
it say here that some man gain sympathy weight when their partner get pregnant
if that happen to me -PRON- would be miserable
but happy
but sad
i would have never imagine the baby make process to be this clinical
i mean imagine if actual sex be like this
let_me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our gene
and -PRON- ' also weird because we date and we remember what -PRON- ' like to engage in some of those physical activity
exactly
and we be also pretty good at those physical activity

these hearing have two goal
one to find out exactly how this offensive tweet come to be send
and two to turn this whole_thing into a medium circus
ms._knope do you have a statement

uh a parks and_rec employee forget to log out of the parks and_rec twitter account they post a personal of the parks and_rec private message by accident and uh that person be very sorry and it wo_not happen again
stop stonewall and tell_us what happen here
i just tell you what happen
it be an unfortunate mistake
okay sadly due to your intracksidence"--
not a word
we may never find out what happen
when this sick depraved tweet first come to light you say the account be probably hack by some bored teenager
now -PRON-_'re say -PRON- ' an unfortunate mistake
why do you keep flip flopping
well because i learn new information
when i be four i think that chocolate milk come from brown cow and then i flip flop when i find out that there be something call chocolate syrup
i do not think -PRON- be out of line when i say that this scandal make benghazi look like whitewater
-PRON- ' utterly meaningless
i think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet
perhaps he or she-- or them
it could be a_bunch_of hot lady
yes perhaps them can finally give us the answer we need
what what what
there she be
nadia i do not know what you want so i get you a cappuccino a latte four bag of coffee bean and a mini espresso machine
what happen to your accent

t. dazzle
t. dazzle
thank you for the woodworking lesson ron
this whole crib recall thing have get me literally rethink everything i think i know about parenting
what sleep method will you be using-- ferber sears
swanson method where you close your eye and fall_asleep
i really wish ron would engage but he exude so_much wisdom that i can learn parenting tip simply by be in his presence
someone like ron be teach even when -PRON-_'re not teach
do that make_sense
my anxiety have keep me up for over 50 hour
our polling show that 72% of citizen be in favor of add t dazzle to their water effectively kill councilman_jamm 's so call clean water bill
eat it jamm
i win
apology accept
you know -PRON- have actually come around to your way of think on this
my only thought be why stop here
lady and gentleman sweetums president jessica_wicks
whoo
look we all love t dazzle
but we can do more to improve our drinking supply
sweetums be excited to propose an alternative to boring municipal water
we call it drink ems
whoo
sweetums be prepared to take over the management of pawnee 's water
this be gon_na save this town beaucoup buck
take a sip of this delicious water and imagine it come out of your faucet at home
this water be fill_with sugar
there ' absolutely no way we be do this
checkmate
do you bring those with you just to do that
maybe
damn
it be a baller move
what be we gon_na do now leslie
hey
okay be you still mad_at_me about the poodle thing
it be just a dumb game
i can pick another dog
-PRON- be not mad about the choice
-PRON- be mad about your reason
pretty
makeup"-- be that all you know about me
we do not hang_out that much
-PRON- ' not like you know a ton about me
-PRON-_'re beautiful yet cold and aloof
you pride yourself on be a loner
you do not obey you choose to cooperate
and when you stop bar your fang to pick a mate -PRON- ' for life
and -PRON-_'re fiercely loyal to your pack which make you a rare black siberian husky
that be so spot on it be scary
i need to go lie down for 45 minute
no an_hour a full hour
good_morning
this wo_not take long
simply put it would be madness to let sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar
what ' next-- cookie dough toothpaste
bad example
that would be amazing
my point be sweetums be an evil profit hungry corporation that be ruin our health
ever_since sweetums open its door obesity be up 100%
-PRON- ' unacceptable
down with that poison peddle corporate monster
down with sweetums
hey
hey
hear about your speech
sound great
i wish you could have see it
it feel so good
i love loose cannon
you know i love the power of no consequence
well unfortunately there have be one consequence
i just get fire from sweetums
because you be embezzle i hope
hey jessica do you do something to your hair
because sister you look good enough to eat
num num num num num
what do you want leslie
you can not punish ben for something i do
-PRON- ' not fair
i love him and i will do anything to help him get his job back
what do you want
i want you to formally apologize for what you say about sweetums
i want you to say that -PRON-_'re a moral upstanding corporation that -PRON-_'re proud to have in pawnee
and when you make your apology i want you to wear a lime green pantsuit because it will look horrible on you
you be such an autumn
do you need me for something

excellent
thank you very_much for your time
i will have your answer shortly
no idea
if a joint be properly fashion all you need to do be guide it into place
all you need to do be guide it into place
what i get from that be when parenting sometimes a subtle hand be more effective than a strong one
this be already so_much more helpful than the last book on parenting i read-- rad dad by apolo anton ohno and shaun white
nah
ron why do you throw that wood away
-PRON- ' unstable
-PRON- ' no good
i just do not understand the throw away the wood metaphor
what ' the lesson
oh i know
-PRON- ' potty training
that trash can be the toilet and the wood be the feces
chris -PRON- be not teach you anything
-PRON-_'re just build a crib
no i know -PRON-_'re not consciously teach me anything
-PRON- be try to siphon off some of your calm center wisdom through metaphor
metaphor
i hate metaphor
that ' why my_favorite book be moby dick-- no froufrou symbolism just a good simple tale about a man who hat an animal
that ' enough for today i think
an organized child be a-- no
okay -PRON- have be work on this for three hour and i know your spirit_dog
you be a nova scotia toller because -PRON-_'re outgoing and adventurous
and you love canada
no that ' not right
no it be n't
but i appreciate the effort
-PRON-_'re good
and do not beat yourself up
-PRON- will probably never guess what kind_of dog i be
-PRON-_'re right
-PRON- will never guess what kind_of dog you be because -PRON-_'re not a dog
-PRON-_'re a cat
-PRON-_'re temperamental
-PRON-_'re unpredictable complex and hard to read
you make people work before you let them in
but if they put the time in and prove that they care then you open yourself up to them
right
no no no no no no no
hmm
so let_'s all raise a glass full of delicious sugary drinking water to sweetums-- a pawnee institution
leslie do not do this
i have to ben
we can not both be out of a job
what will we do-- sleep all day take cook class together sit on a couch and watch movie
god that sound horrible
there ' more at stake here
i mean you apologize -PRON- will be an endorsement for the drink ems plan
i know that
but-- and everything you say about sweetums be right on
i mean 90% of the charity work i do be to compensate for mess they cause
and i do not want to work for them anymore
be you sure
yeah just go up there stick to your gun
-PRON- ' not gon_na make a difference
i can not beat them
all i have on my side be fact and science and people hate fact and science
wait
i have_an_idea
go get tom
run
get tom
yesterday i say some pretty harsh thing about sweetums and their great new product
but when i look_at the research i find some pretty compelling fact about drink ems that make me change my tune
each drink em be pack with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement
mpp be an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 ph buffer
now i know what -PRON-_'re thinking-- what about its molar mass
how do 136.086 grab you
what the-- i do not know about y'_all but drink em seem pretty boring to me not like h-2-flow
excuse_me
i have several binder with very_important datum that i need to get through
well miss i think -PRON- would all appreciate it if you just swallow a teaspoon of hush
think of h-2-flow as an app for your tooth
the more flow you take in the more sparkle point you get
get enough sparkle point and -PRON-_'re on your way to your first aqua badge collect enough aqua badge and -PRON- will welcome you to the h-2-flow platinum club
-PRON- be great at business and -PRON- be great at park stuff
-PRON- be like picasso meet michael jordan

that ' not a lesson by the way just a comment on lumber availability
-PRON- ' beautiful
thank you
nobody have all the right answer in parenting include me
and that toxic crib you buy wo_not be the last mistake you make
but a man who ' this worried_about make all the right choice care very_much
that ' all that matter
-PRON- will be a great father
thank you ron for the crib and the advice
-PRON- ' much good_than any metaphor
do the white whale actually symbolize the unknowability and meaninglessness of human existence
no
-PRON- ' just a bleep fish
hey good_news

before we do that i be think more about that chard guy
i mean it would be very easy for you to revoke their license
okay leslie this be city business and -PRON- be not an emperor
i can not just kick them out for no reason
the reason be -PRON- 's vegetable porn
porn on the cob
-PRON- be sorry
-PRON- be just very good at that
look i be not a prude but the point be people should not be half naked you know in public in the middle of the day in_front_of child
there ' your reason
kick them out
look now that -PRON-_'re work together again maybe it would be good to keep our home life and our work life separate
like we only talk_about work stuff when -PRON-_'re at_city_hall like a firewall system
yeah
yeah okay
that ' smart
home be home and work be work
we can always talk_about this tomorrow at the office

glad you agree
all_right
crystal skull it be
no -PRON- ' ridiculous to think that you could survive a nuclear blast by jump into a refrigerator
mm_hmm yeah uh_huh

okay so i find a legal precedent to shut_down those vegetable smut peddler
what be happen
firewall man
we pull into the parking_lot and this be technically city_hall property so now -PRON-_'re at work-- let_'s do this
the farmer_market be a community meeting place and that pan sexual stripper show basically negate the whole purpose

the new farmer_market rule book

-PRON-_'re open a new office in chicago
i spend the last few_week read about you and your career and i think that -PRON-_'re the perfect person to run it
leslie would you like to run a branch of the national_park_service
tom_'s_bistro will have all the classic element but with modern twists-- an oak bar live music and sunday brunch with scramble egg so fluffy -PRON- will be like little pillow for your bacon
bacon pillow
i like the sound of that
but i have to say restaurant be incredibly risky
most of them be dead on arrival
-PRON-_'re well aware of that but believe me tom have think this out
see there ' plenty_of real_estate available in the old eagleton part_of town
and with the recent closure there ' massive demand for affordable dining that feel high_end
okay
as_long_as -PRON-_'re run -PRON- be in
amazing

i come here to think sometimes
by myself
but now that -PRON-_'re here
damn_it
i be go to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that i have and you can not ask me any_question or detail about it
that be my ideal conversation aside from no conversation
but that feel unlikely
look you know how_much i love pawnee
but the more i try to fix it the more people fight me
they call me name they recall me they try to kill the merger
they literally punch me in the face
and yet every_time i contemplate leave just walk away once and for all i just can not do it
what be wrong_with me
yesterday i fix that old steam radiator
thread a new valve into the side remove the handle from the base unscrew the packing nut from the stem

i would also add that -PRON- have already do a hell of a lot to make this town better and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard_work

but mitch ask me what i be passionate_about and honestly -PRON- be never gon_na be passionate_about dry cleaning chemical
to each his_own i guess
i know open a restaurant be risky but i can make this work
i know i can
then count me in as the second investor in tom_'s_bistro

okay my fortieth and eighteenth from last question be about the heartland exotic plant management project
now be would i be actually do the physical planting
because it be always be a dream of mine to plant spot jewelweed along the red river bank in arkansas but -PRON- be sure you hear that a lot
well you would not actually be plant thing
i mean -PRON-_'re oversee the everyday minutia you would delegate to staff
leslie your job be more creative big picture stuff
no more boring people work for you

i hate paperwork
i hardly ever do it in my bed on a saturday night while listen to old spice girl cd
regal meagle

so -PRON-_'re just about ready to go live with the slogan poll
you want to see
now that eagleton and pawnee have merge it be time to pick a new town_slogan
and a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town 's identity
there be new york the city that never sleep
and then there be glenwater florida home of america 's most violent walmart parking_lot
okay so people can vote now
yeah see that ' the super cool thing about this website be it do all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy
no
no -PRON-_'re not gon_na do that
-PRON-_'re gon_na sit forward and take it hard
um what
there ' a_lot_of nitty gritty left to do ben
we need to roll up our sleeve we need to go door to door we need to hand out flier and canvas
you know what we should do
we should have a press junket to publicize the poll
okay i hope you have lunch plan 'cause now you get to cancel them
well i i do
so this be one of eagleton 's top sushi restaurant
but you can not out run the whale meat police forever
this be great

that ' where the politician will sit this be where the connected guy will bring their goomahs
this place be perfect
how_much
9,000 a month
what
that ' way more that i can afford
whatever
-PRON- ' not that great
plus -PRON- ' really far_away_from work and that 'd be annoying
-PRON- ' not a big_deal
i mean when it first launch -PRON- will go back and forth but hopefully it take off and -PRON- will become a full time job
come_on -PRON- will show some place in your price range
this press junket be a brilliant idea be not it
mr. strange cameraman

quiet cameraman perd 's here
leslie your poll be design to choose a new slogan

if i -PRON-_'re a dictator i would throw the douche in prison without a trial
i would be a very strong dictator and you would be my bodyguard and you would lead my army
okay i know we should figure_out_how to fix this
but -PRON- be start to get kind_of turn on imagine you as a dictator be that bad

this be the last listing i have that be not an active crime scene
hey man what happen

we stretch ourselves too thin by expand to a second location
you open another dinosaur theme restaurant

i actually think the space be pretty_cool
obviously -PRON- would have to move this t rex but-- no can do
that ' a load bear t rex
this be really the last place you have available
dang
maybe tom_'s_bistro be not mean to be
you want to see me
yeah real_quick
remember when you say you would close up shop on the slogan thing
yes
you do do that right
you do not somehow get the email address for every person_who vote for the stick up the butt slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email tell them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan
be you crazy
what a crazy talk you just do with your funny word
well someone write those email
and we get about 300 complaint and as a cherry on top some hacker get really mad about the invasion of privacy and attack the website
look what they do to peebo
-PRON- ' wear a hat make of penis
oh_boy
well i.t. be fix the website but it will be down for about three day
well no_worry i will handle all of the overflow work personally
park ticket code violations-- send them all to me
what ' go on
i do not know
i speak to grant about the national_park job and he mention that ' mostly big picture planning and delegating and not very_much nitty gritty hand on stuff that i love to do
i would miss that very_much
i mean have i really pull my last bloat raccoon carcass from a public fountain
but that ' the whole point of move up the ladder you get to think big swim in a big pond
-PRON-_'re have a public_forum on the slogan right
use it as a test
hand the rein to someone_else let them handle thing while you manage from a distance
yeah
that ' a good_idea
i guess i should practice delegate
ugh
okay
the public_forum will be run by
oh no i would not have start the sentence if i know larry be the only one here
babe if you can step back and let larry take control you can survive anything
all_right
larry can you get in here
i would love to
gosh darn it
i
i somehow run my belt through a slat in this chair so -PRON- be kind_of i'm kind_of stuck to it now

-PRON- ' an embarrassing footnote
but -PRON- ' our embarrassing footnote
-PRON- have recently self publish a biography about harrison entitle barely a president
william_henry_harrison 's thirty two day in the white house
i discover that harrison have a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land -PRON-_'re try to acquire
um spoiler much
now -PRON- will never read that book
if a us president have a house on that land it could qualify for historic landmark status and we could really stick it to ron 's team

people would come from mile just to see it
why
be there something inside the stupid ball

and i think you do know that datum mining be not chill because you sneak it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement
a person should not have to have an advanced law degree to avoid be take advantage of by a multi billion dollar company
you should be upfront about what -PRON-_'re do and allow people the ability to opt out
to be honest judge perd be stump by this case
-PRON- have also misplace my judge hammer

we try to clean_up this neighborhood so_many time
nothing ' work
we send a street cleaner through here a few_month ago raccoon eat the wheel right off it
councilman_dexhart represent this district and 10_year ago when he be elect he promise to clean it up
instead he just give it a fancy new name beachview terrace
a more accurate name for this place
medical waste butt sweat grove
hi sorry -PRON- be late
-PRON- have have this list for seven year and no one 's ever ask to see it
i think this be a prank call
this place have everything
vermin bullet hole a hornet 's nest
look i appreciate everything that you guy have do for me but even if i put in the time and the money to refurbish this trash heap -PRON- ' not gon_na change the fact that no respectable people live in this part_of town anymore
damn straight
everything would have to magically change
the whole neighborhood would have to suddenly become safe and clean and have business and people who dine out
no then -PRON- would have to move again
be you think
-PRON- ' possible
but how would we pr
pr
which you could then
yes
right
okay good
guys we have about five day to do three_month worth of work but if we pull it off we can rescue jj_'s_diner we can establish a new national_park and we can save pawnee forever
who ' in
i be
oh_my_god
where_'d you come from
the floor hole
hey
how be your trip
great obviously
bedazzle that elbow
how be everything here
uneventful
so i be think about the idea of go to donna 's wedding
wait before you say anything
i do not think you should go to donna 's wedding to supervise catering
oh
i want you to come with me as my date
oh
the thing be you work for me
so -PRON- ' probably kind_of uncool for me to even ask
which be why i sign these document transfer day to day operation of tom_'s_bistro over to craig
-PRON- will be your bos now
not me
-PRON- ' about time
-PRON-_'re lose the cranberry salad effective_immediately
you do not have to do this

-PRON-_'re great at your job and i want you work here forever and if you do not have feeling for me
i need you to know that everything be gon_na be fine

i be not even serious
-PRON- have be hoax
-PRON- have be tommy ed
just hold_on
i be gon_na say that i would not wanna go with you as friend
i wanna go with you as your date
oh

craig never_mind
you can rip these paper up

oh_god
-PRON- would better get back there
you guy i do not know what this be about but -PRON- ' 4:13 so you get seven minute
well we just want to introduce you to the new home of the gryzzl campus
be you trip
we just spend $ 125 million to build our new campus in the southern_indiana foothills
and -PRON- will be spend another $_100 million at_least to construct the building road plumbing electrical
whereas here at beachview terrace you can take over five entire square block of historic pawnee
here ' a complete proposal for gryzzl 's new regional corporate headquarters
be this paper
super throwback
my company inspect all the building
they be disgusting i grant you but the gut be solid
-PRON- have lay out construction cost retail space option
you could build a much big campus in this neighborhood and basically break even
plus the good part all the building come pre graffitied
that ' true
we would not have to hire banksy
okay but we spend hella skrilla on this trill forest
so what be we suppose_to do with that
here ' a far out idea that just come to the top of my brainium
why do not you donate that land to the national_park_service
that would be pretty dope
and you could get some baller tax break that could help you with that mad stank construction cost
i do not know
-PRON- be sorry i ca_n't
i can not say these word
okay
but why could not we just build the campus here and then keep the land or sell it
you could
but donate it will give you some good pr
which you desperately need
i mean look we be glad that you pick pawnee but if -PRON-_'re gon_na set_up shop here you need to make a covenant with the city
show people that -PRON-_'re invest in this town
start by clean_up one part_of pawnee and preserve the other
okay well i get_ta talk to my board as well as our chief legal counsel and our senior advisory team

-PRON- ' a large scale storage unit for surplus vinyl sheeting

so you know lose a battle win the war
that kind_of thing
-PRON- ' the way to go
look
the pie_mary be retrogressive and misogynistic and if you participate we will have no choice but to protest you and ben at the event
hope you like pie
in your face metaphorically
-PRON- will be civil
elise
there be no big defender of gender equality than leslie_knope
and my_husband ben be a progressive champion of woman 's right

the tooth
-PRON-_'re yours
you be super out of it
you keep yell team voldemort
at the screen
and we be kick out
i be furious
you only get to see the second twilight film for the seventh time once
do you remember anything about a key
or april do anything unusual that day

which normally be why i love them but now -PRON- be on the other_side
oh_my_god ben i give them $_100 in their annual pledge
do you know how_many anti me sign that could buy
you just do not do the pie contest obviously
then -PRON-_'re just back where we start
then it just seem_like -PRON- be say -PRON- be good_than the woman who bake
what should we do
should we get a divorce
well how about this
what if i register for the contest
i bake the pie
i act as my own wife
oh that could work
we sidestep the controversy we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate
and then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head
exactly
but_more_importantly we change the idea of what a pie be
i feel_like that ' not more_important but i like the energy that we have so let_'s hear it
okay picture this crust on the bottom
filling
crust on top
what be i describe
a pie
no
but -PRON-_'re in the right zone
oh
calzone

pie be just sweet calzones honey
and -PRON- be good at make calzones
-PRON-_'re amazing
i can win this thing
of_course you can baby
get in there and start bake
-PRON- be have some serious dã©jã vu
how_many time have you lose your wedding ring
too many time to count
and it cause real trouble with gayle
and any time i lose my ring she turn_into a real grumpy goose
be that so
oh yeah
-PRON- will say you know garry -PRON- would lose your head if it be not screw on tight
and then she make me go for the fresh orange for the morning oj
and she say hey mr. forgetful
i mean those word they rattle around here for hour
that ' why -PRON- have get_ta be extra careful with this replacement ring because if i lose -PRON- be gon_na order us some dinner
the shoeshine_stand be go
or maybe it be never here
they must have move it during the remodel
-PRON- ' probably in basement storage
to the basement
tighter
you sure dude
yeah dude
tighter
i can do it
do what exactly
nothing
-PRON-_'re not do anything
and we definitely do not live down here now
guy where ' the old shoeshine_stand from upstairs
we do not know anything about that
boy think
we be on a quest and we be not leave until we get an answer
well -PRON-_'re on our own quest which be to squeeze this just tight enough to make my eye bulge out a_little_bit but not so tight that i die
-PRON- have be there
that ' a real tightrope walk
oh
hey
last_week this real scary ghost come down here look for it
it have black hair but you could see through his skin
it do not like me but that ' just 'cause i get a soul of a ghostbuster
yeah it say something about how it be worried brett be gon_na mug it
okay
so -PRON-_'re look for a racist ghost with black hair who like shoeshine
i think i have the answer
the chase continue
okay wait
at the time that you tell_us you be mug in the park what be you reach for in the river
a burrito
that ' right
you fall_in the river reach for a burrito
yes_ma'am
that be not one of my fine moment
ooh
-PRON- ' get late
we need to bounce
i can give you a ride
oh thank you donna
probably gon_na get an earful when i get home tonight
gayle may even call me the b word
bozo
wow

oh yeah
-PRON-_'re good
the iow be not gon_na protest us
how ' your pie
i do not know
i do not make a pie
okay
how be your dessert calzone
-PRON- ' ready
the question be be they
all_right our next contestant be candidate ben_wyatt 's wife leslie
let_'s see what mrs. wyatt have bake up for us shall_we
-PRON- ' actually ms._knope
and actually right_now -PRON- ' mr._wyatt
leslie have her own busy life and i happen to be an excellent pie maker so we figure -PRON- would switch it up a bit
now pack your suitcase because -PRON-_'re go to a little town call napoli in italy
free ben_wyatt
free ben_wyatt
free ben_wyatt
excuse_me free me from what
from the tyranny of woman
we be the male men
we be a man 's right activist group and we be feed up
-PRON- be sorry
what ' happen now
behind every successful woman be a man she have oppress
first leslie_knope poach her husband 's campaign by make it all about her
now -PRON- ' force him to bake pie and enter a contest for her
excuse_me
-PRON- be not force him to do anything
he love to cook
yeah
he have five personalized apron
oh
so i guess he be ask for it because of the way he be dress
we be sick and tired of this feminized society
man have have a very rough go of it for just recently
and it end now
male and proud
male and proud
male and proud
leslie_knope exemplify the feminist attack on our value
she could learn a little something about traditional family structure from me and my_husband marshall
um
fierce alert
eat 'em up honey
the idea that feminism be an attack on family value be absurd
ooh
so -PRON-_'re defend leslie_knope
no
absolutely not
frankly i do not think -PRON- ' do enough to distance herself from this misogynistic lunacy
let_'s turn now to sasha dunkirk
she be head of the group women against feminism
what a surprise
the woman be only talk to other woman
can we have one conversation about feminism where man get to be in_charge
i actually agree with him
i do not need your pity
joan leslie_knope and i be united
oh
in our disgust of this week 's event
leslie if -PRON-_'re watch i brandi_maxxxx star of 69 jump street and fifty shaved old gays have your back
oof
you really step in it this time knope
why be not the other candidate 's wife be scrutinize like this
because june hartwell be a lukewarm bowl of nothing
she start an awareness campaign call bring a sweater
she call it goose bump prevention
come_on you guy you know the drill
just ignore the fact that -PRON-_'re right put on your blandest outfit so that one hopefully and then just go out there and publicly apologize
do
what
apologize for what
do not matter
just say -PRON-_'re sorry
-PRON- ' like take a shot of tequila
you just get_ta force it down suddenly the world feel so_much more pleasant
i do three shot every_time i have to enter this house
donna

good afternoon
-PRON- be here today to share with you all my vision for the economic future of southern_indiana
but first leslie_knope my_wife have a brief statement
hello_everyone
thank you
wow
how about this weather -PRON-_'re have
very temperate
okay
recently i make an attempt to actually hang_on
stop
-PRON- be sorry this whole_thing just make me queasy
i love how independent my_wife be and because of that i will not let her speak
that come out wrong
the point be leslie be a great mother public_servant all around person and i be tired of everybody constantly tell her that -PRON- ' make the wrong choice
so you can say whatever you want i could not care less about the political consequence
thank you ben
well
the first thing -PRON- be gon_na do be say sorry
-PRON- be sorry that the spotlight be on me and not on ben because he be go to make a great congressman
second the male man where be you
ah
-PRON-_'re ridiculous and man 's right be nothing
third -PRON- be now gon_na give you permanent answer to all the silly question that -PRON-_'re gon_na end_up ask me and every other woman in this election over the next few_month
why do i change my hairstyle
oh i do not know
i just think it would look good
or my kid get gum in it
be you try to have it all
that question make no sense
-PRON- ' a stupid question
stop ask it
do not ask it
do you miss your kid while -PRON-_'re at work
yes of_course i do
everybody do
and then you know sometimes i do_n't
yeah
and by the way no one 's ever ask me that question
no one ask me where be your kid
or who ' take_care_of them
by the way who be take_care_of the kid right_now
my_mom babe
everything ' fine
right
so maybe leslie do not fit your personal idea of what a candidate 's wife should be
so what
that ' good because there should not be just one idea anyway
that ' right
if you wanna bake a pie that ' great
if you wanna have a career that ' great too
do both or neither it do not matter
just do not judge what someone_else have decide to do
-PRON-_'re all just try to find the right path for us
as individual
on this earth
-PRON- would say that ' fifty fifty boo and cheer
yeah
that seem about right
let ben speak
let ben speak
he just speak

my bad
so i guess we be celebrate that you trust_me and i let you down
great
i change my house lock every 16 day
that key have be useless since the second tuesday after i give it to you
what matter be that i trust you and admire you as a person

i have since move it
or have i
elise
what do i do wrong now

-PRON- ' totally happen
our kid be fall_in love
this be good
okay remember
if this be ever go to work we have to pretend to disapprove
yeah

good call
hey
leslie no
oh
who_care
ann arbor michigan be literally the great city that i have ever live in
but pawnee be good
so -PRON-_'re move back
that ' great
yeah
-PRON- be go to run admission at indiana
-PRON- be trade wolverines for hoosiers
well -PRON-_'re get the good end of that deal
tom
i take the quiz in your book about what kind_of person i be
-PRON- be a ron
ha
-PRON- be usually a tom but sometimes -PRON- be a donna
last_time i take it i be a tom
what
no
no no no
take it again
-PRON- have get to go recalibrate the quiz
so do anyone have any insight on our running for governor situation
-PRON- have be so busy catch up with everyone
i haven't have a chance to ask them
yeah me neither
okay here ' what i think
i hate when -PRON-_'re on opposite side
it stink
plus if one of us run it do not mean -PRON-_'re go to win
right
and -PRON- ' not like this be the only career option for either of us
so all that matter be that we be good
right
which be why i have_an_idea
i think we should flip a coin
i mean it
let_'s literally flip a coin
because whoever run be go to do a great_job
and whoever do not run be go to be right alongside the other one offer advice and support and whatever they need
so it do not matter
so let_'s flip a coin
okay
you leslie_knope the queen of planning and binder and pro and con list
you want to leave this to chance
yes
because whatever ' next you and i be in it together
so let_'s_go tell everybody
and they can participate and they can sign the coin and then you know the coin will eventually make its way into the smithsonian
okay everybody gather_around
first of all i just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same_time with your child here -PRON- ' like -PRON- ' the great thing that ' ever happen in the history of america
and secondly ben and i have an announcement
leslie be run for governor of indiana
what
bully for you knope
that ' amazing
yeah she get approach by the dnc and they think she have a great shot to win
indiana native supremely qualified
and she write that she want to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal
this make_sense
so -PRON- be run for governor
ben be go to be run my campaign because -PRON- ' a super genius and -PRON- ' get a tight compact little body like an italian sport car
but right_now -PRON- would like to make a toast
when we work here together we fight scratch and claw to make people 's life a tiny bit better
that ' what public_service be all about
small incremental change every_day
teddy roosevelt once say far and away the good prize that life have to offer be a chance to work_hard at work worth do
and i would add that what make work worth do be get to do it with people that you love
i start my career more_than 30_year ago in the parks_and_recreation department right here in pawnee_indiana
-PRON- have have a_lot_of different job include two term as your governor
and soon a new unknown challenge await me
which to me even now be thrilling because i love the work
not to say that public_service be not sexy
because it definitely be
but that ' not why we do it
we do it because we get the chance to work_hard at work worth do alongside a team of people who we love
so i thank those people who have walk with me and i thank you for this honor
now go find your team and get to work
in addition to governor knope 's honorary doctorate from the school of public policy in recognition of all she have do for the people of indiana the campus library will henceforth bear her name
a library
yeah that should do it
the swing be fix
